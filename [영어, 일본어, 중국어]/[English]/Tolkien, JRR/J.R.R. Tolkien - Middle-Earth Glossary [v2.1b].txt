* Adanedhel
'Elf-man', name given to T?in in Nargothrond.
-----
T?in the son of H?in, though a Man, was raised from childhood in the halls of King Thingol of Doriath. When, later in his life, he went to dwell among the Elves of Nargothrond, they recognised the nobility he had learned in Thingol's kingdom, and gave him the name Adanedhel, meaning 'Elf-man'.


* Adorn
A river that rose in the western heights of the White Mountains, and flowed roughly northwestward to meet the Isen on the borders of Enedwaith. It was important as defining the western border of the country of Rohan.


* Adrahil #1|Adrahil
A commander of the forces of Gondor against the Wainriders in Third Age 1944; called 'of Dol Amroth', and presumably an ancestor of the second Adrahil.


* Adrahil #2|Adrahil
Prince of Dol Amroth, father of Imrahil.
-----
The twenty-first Prince of Dol Amroth, descended in direct line from Galador the first Prince. Adrahil was the son of Angelimar, and father of Imrahil who fought in the War of the Ring.


* Aduial
The Elvish name for the twilight of dusk (the dim light of evening). The twilight of dawn they named minuial.


* Ad?aic|Adunaic
'(Language of the) West'. The native tongue of the N?en?eans, the ancestral language of Westron. Evolved from the old tongue used by the Men of the House of Hador.
 Though the name Ad?aic cannot have been used before the Edain travelled to N?enor at the beginning of the Second Age, the language itself, or something very close to it, seems to have been spoken in Beleriand during the First Age, at least by the people of the House of Hador. While there is no mention of its use after the Downfall, it cannot have become completely extinct at this date; it seems likely that the scholars of Gondor and of Arnor would have been familiar with the ancient tongue of their ancestors, but in general use Ad?aic was replaced by the Westron (which had developed from it) and Elvish languages.


* Adunakh?|Adunakhor
'Lord of the West', name taken by the nineteenth King of N?enor, the first to do so in the Ad?aic (N?en?ean) tongue; his name in Quenya was Herun?en.


* Adurant
The sixth and most southerly of the tributaries of Gelion in Ossiriand. The name means 'double stream', referring to its divided course about the island of Tol Galen.
-----

* Aeglos (plant)|Aeglos
'Snowthorn', a plant that grew on Amon R?h.


* Aeglos (spear)|Aeglos
'Snow-point', the spear of Gil-galad, carried by him to the War of the Last Alliance.


* Aegnor
The fourth son of Finarfin (and elder brother of Galadriel), who with his brother Angrod held the northern slopes of Dorthonion; slain in the Dagor Bragollach. The name means 'Fell Fire'.


* Aelin-uial
The 'Meres of Twilight', or 'Lakes of Twilight'; the region of marshes and pools where the river Aros flowed into Sirion.
-----
The maze of lakes and fens formed where the River Aros met the Sirion, before it fell beneath the Andram. These were lands heavy with enchantment, both from the Girdle of Melian guarding Doriath to the north, but also from the power of Ulmo that was strong in Sirion's waters. It was here that Turgon and Finrod were given the idea of building their hidden strongholds at Gondolin and Nargothrond; an idea placed in their dreams by Ulmo.
 The Aelin-uial was under the control of the Sindarin Kingdom of Doriath. Thingol's marchwardens maintained secret ferries among the reeds, so that they could cross between Sirion's easten and western banks unregarded, if need be.
 At the southern end of the Aelin-uial, Sirion's waters collected together once more from the many paths they took through the marshland and, at the place called the Falls of Sirion, fell in a thundering torrent down into the earth.
 Other Names: Meres of Twilight, Twilight Meres, Twilit Meres.

* Afteryule
The first month of the Shire Calendar, thirty days immediately following the holiday of Yule (hence its name). It ran from modern 23 December to 21 January.

-----
The Glittering Caves.
-----
"... gems and crystals and veins of precious ore glint in the polished walls; and the light glows through folded marbles, shell-like, translucent as the living hands of Queen Galadriel."
(From Gimli's description of Aglarond; The Two Towers III 8, The Road to Isengard)
-----
The deep caverns that lay behind Helm's Deep in the White Mountains. When Gimli saw them during the War of the Ring, he was astonished by their beauty. After the War he led a party of Dwarves from Erebor to Aglarond, and became Lord of the Glittering Caves.

* Ailinel
The elder of Tar-Aldarion's sisters.


* Ainulindal?(Music)|Ainulindal?Ainulindale
The 'Music of the Ainur', also called The (Great) Music, The (Great) Song, of which its name is the Quenya version. The great song of the Ainur before Il?atar at the beginning of time, in which the world was created.


* Ainulindal?(Tale)|Ainulindal?Ainulindale
The name of the account of Creation said to have been composed by R?il of Tirion in the Elder Days.


* Ainur|Ainu
The 'Holy Ones' (singular Ainu), the first beings created by Il?atar, the 'order' of the Valar and Maiar, made before E?
-----
The Holy Ones.
-----
"There was Eru, the One, who in Arda is called Il?atar; and he made first the Ainur, the Holy Ones, that were the offspring of his thought..."
(First words of the Ainulindal?
-----
The primordial spirits, who existed with Il?atar, and with Him created the world through the Music of the Ainur. After the creation of Arda, many of the Ainur descended into it to guide and order its growth; of these there were fifteen more powerful than the rest. Fourteen of these great Ainur became the Valar, or Powers of Arda. The fifteenth, Melkor, turned aside from that path and became the first Dark Lord. The many lesser Ainur that accompanied the Valar into Arda are known as Maiar.
-----
Origins of the Ainur: The Ainur were the first, and mightiest, beings created by Il?atar in the depths of time before the beginning of the World. The Ainur were the 'offspring of [Il?atar's] thought', and each was given understanding only of that part of the mind of Il?atar from which he or she came. The exception to this was Melkor, the greatest of the Ainur, who had a part of the gifts of all the others.
 The Ainur were 'kindled with the Flame Imperishable', which can be taken to mean that they were granted free will by their creator. Il?atar instructed them in the arts of music, until he brought them together to make the Music of the Ainur; the great song that created the Vision of Il?atar and ultimately the real World.
-----
The Ainur and the World: Through the Music of the Ainur, Il?atar created a Vision of the World; he showed it to the Ainur, and explained much of its nature and destiny to them - so the Ainur have much knowledge of the World, but are not omniscient. Then, Il?atar granted the World true being. Melkor and many of the other mighty Ainur desired to descend into it and form it in readiness for the coming of the Children of Il?atar (that is, Elves and Men). These became the beings known as the Valar and the Maiar.
 Those Ainur who entered the World at its beginning remain bound to it until its end. Though Melkor was eventually thrown into the Void by the others, he is prophesied to return before the end. Little is known of the ultimate future of the Ainur, even by themselves, but it is said that, after the great battle at the end of the World, they will make a Second, even greater, Music with the Children of Il?atar.
-----
The Line of Melian: Among the many Ainur that entered the World long ago, there was one of the order of the Maiar named Melian. Alone of all the Ainur, she wedded one of the Children of Il?atar, King Elu Thingol of Doriath. From her, a strain of the Ainur entered the bloodlines of the Elves and Men, passed down through generation after generation, and was still present at the time of the War of the Ring. Elrond was Melian's great-great-grandson, and Aragorn, too, was her descendant, though through many more generations than Elrond.


* Aiwendil
'Bird-lover', the name in Valinor of the Wizard who became known as Radagast in Middle-earth.


* Akallab?h|Akallabeth
'The Downfallen', Ad?aic word equivalent in meaning to Quenya Atalant? A name of N?enor after its destruction.


* Akallab?h (tale)|Akallab?h|Akallabeth
The account of the Downfall of N?enor.


* Alatar
One of the five Wizards who came to the northwest of Middle-earth in the Third Age; he journeyed into the east with Pallando, and never returned to the western lands.
-----
One of the lost Blue Wizards.
 One of the five Wizards who came to the northwest of Middle-earth in the Third Age; he journeyed into the east with Pallando, and never returned to the western lands.
 Alatar was one of the original three Wizards selected by the Valar for the journey from Valinor to Middle-earth (the other two being Curumo and Ol?in - Saruman and Gandalf).
 Alatar and Pallando arrived in Middle-earth dressed in sea-blue. For this reason, they were together given the name Ithryn Luin, the Blue Wizards. With Saruman, they journeyed into the far east of Middle-earth, but while Saruman returned to the west, Alatar and Pallando did not. Of their fate, we know almost nothing.


* Alat?iel|Alatariel|Alt?iel|Altariel
'Maiden crowned with a radiant garland'; also Alt?iel. An ancient form (Quenya and Telerin) of the name of Galadriel.


* Alcarin
'The Glorious'; the title of Atanatar II, who ruled Gondor during the early second millennium of the Third Age, in a time when its wealth and power were legendary. This title means 'Glorious', but in fact Atanatar did little to build on the advances of his forebears, and history came to see his reign as the beginning of Gondor's decline.


* Alcarinqu?Alcarinque
'The Glorious', name of a star.


* Alcarondas
The great ship of Ar-Pharaz? in which he sailed to Aman.
-----
Called the Castle of the Sea, Alcarondas was the golden-and-black flagship of Ar-Pharaz?, the last King of N?enor. In it, he sailed to the shores of Aman to challenge the Valar, leading to the Downfall of his kingdom.


* Aldamir
The successor to Eldacar of Gondor.
 In the time of the Kin-strife, the civil war of Gondor, King Eldacar was deposed by Castamir and his eldest son Ornendil was slain. Eldacar later recovered his rightful Kingship, but because of Ornendil's early death he was succeeded by his younger son Aldamir. Aldamir's reign was marked by war with the southern lands, including the Haven of Umbar that had been seized by Castamir's supporters. Aldamir was slain in that war and succeeded by his son Vinyarion, who avenged his father's death by conquering the Haradrim, after which he ruled as Hyarmendacil II.


* Aldarion and Erendis
One of the few N?en?ean tales to survive the Downfall; the history of Tar-Aldarion, the sixth King of N?enor, and his estranged wife Erendis.


* Aldaron
'Lord of Trees', a Quenya name occasionally used of the Vala more commonly called Orom? See Tauron.


* Aldburg
The dwelling of ?mer in the Folde (Rohan), where Eorl the Young had his house.
-----
Historic home of Eorl the Young.
 One of the oldest settlements in Rohan, Aldburg stood in the region known as the Folde, some miles to the southeast of Edoras. It is recorded as the home of Eorl himself, and though the royal house moved to Edoras early in Rohan's history, Aldburg remained a seat of noblemen. At the time of the War of the Ring, it was the home of ?mer, who was to inherit the Kingship of Rohan himself.


* Ald?|Aldea
The day of the White Tree.
 The fourth day of the N?en?ean week.


* Aldor
Third King of Rohan, son of Brego son of Eorl the Young.
-----
Rohan's longest-reigning King.
 The second son of King Brego of Rohan. His elder brother Baldor had been lost while attempting to pass the Paths of the Dead, and so Aldor succeeded his father to become the third King of Rohan. He was just twenty-six years old when he came to the throne, and his reign of seventy-five years was the longest in the annals of the Mark. On account of his great age - he reached his one hundred and second year before he died - he is often referred to as Aldor the Old.
 Aldor was the founder of a golden age in Rohan's history. In his time, the Rohirrim increased greatly in numbers, and he succeeded in driving all the Dunlendings from his realm. Aldor had many children, of which the three eldest were daughters. It was his fourth child, Fr?, who succeeded him as King, but due to Aldor's long life, Fr? had to wait until he was himself seventy-five years old before he became Lord of the Mark.


* Aldud?i?Aldudenie
'Lament for the Two Trees', made by a Vanyarin Elf named Elemm??


* Alfirin|Uilos|Simbelmyn?
A small white flower, also called uilos and simbelmyn?(translated Evermind).


* Algund
Man of Dor-l?in, one of the outlaw-band (Gaurwaith) that T?in joined.


* Almaren
'Blessed (place)'; the first abode of the Valar in Arda, before the second onslaught of Melkor: an isle in a great lake in the midst of Middle-earth. After its destruction by Melkor they founded Valinor.
-----
The ancient home of the Valar.
 Before the time of the Two Trees of Valinor, and even before the Valar came to Valinor, they dwelt on the green island of Almaren in the Great Lake. In the mists of time, long before the awakening of Elves or Men, the Valar dwelt east of the Sea in Middle-earth. This was a time called the Spring of Arda, when the Earth was lit by the two Lamps of the Valar, and Almaren lay in the central regions of the World, where the light of the two Lamps mingled.
 Of the details of Almaren we know little - there was green grass on the island, and the Valar had a 'dwelling' there, which presumably constituted a city, or at least a town. In the history of the Valar, Almaren was known as the place where Tulkas wed Nessa.
 Of much greater importance, though, is the fact that Almaren was the site of the Valar's first major defeat at the hands of Melkor: he loosed his forces secretly from his northern fortress of Utumno (then newly delved). Both the Lamps of the Valar were thrown down and destroyed, and Almaren lay in ruins. Tulkas gave chase, but Melkor escaped into the dungeons of Utumno.
 After this, the Valar left Middle-earth and seldom returned. They founded a new land far away to the west, in Aman, that they called Valinor; a land lit by the fabled light of the Two Trees.


* Almarian
Daughter of the N?en?ean mariner V?ntur, Queen to Tar-Meneldur, the fifth King of N?enor, and mother to Tar-Aldarion, the sixth King.


* Almiel
The younger of Tar-Aldarion's sisters.


* Alqualond?Alqualonde
'Haven of the Swans', the chief city and haven of the Teleri on the eastern shores of Aman.
-----
The Swanhaven of the Teleri, on the eastern shores of Aman. This was the site of the Kinslaying in the time immediately before the beginning of the First Age.


* Aman
'Blessed, free from evil', the name of the land in the West, beyond the Great Sea, in which the Valar dwelt after they had left the Isle of Almaren. Often referred to as the Blessed Realm.
-----
The Undying Lands.
 The continent (originally lying in the far West of Arda, now removed from the World) on which the Valar made their home after the destruction of Almaren. There they founded Valinor, and there dwelt the Calaquendi; the Vanyar, the Noldor and those of the Teleri who journeyed from Middle-earth long before the First Age. There were dwellers in Aman before the Valar, though; Ungoliant had long existed in the southern land of Avathar.
 To protect their realm from Melkor, the Valar raised a great range of mountains along the borders of Aman; the Pel?i or Mountains of Defence. They also filled the seas eastwards with shadows and Enchanted Isles.
 In II 3319, King Ar-Pharaz? of N?enor, having been seduced and corrupted by Sauron, sailed on Aman with a great fleet. The King and his armies were destroyed, as was the land of N?enor, and Aman was taken out of the World. After that catastrophe, only the Elves could reach the Blessed Realm.
  The word means 'Blessed Realm'.


* Amandil
'Lover of Aman'; the last lord of And?i?in N?enor, descendant of Elros and father of Elendil. Though an Elf-friend, he was for many years a friend and counsellor to King Ar-Pharaz?. Dismissed by Sauron, he sailed into the West to seek the pardon of the Valar for the misdeeds of the N?en?eans; his fate is unknown.


* Amari?Amarie
Vanyarin Elf, beloved of Finrod Felagund, who remained in Valinor when Finrod returned to Middle-earth.


* Amd?|Amdir
According to some sources, the father of Amroth and King of L?ien during the Second Age. He was killed in the Battle of Dagorlad at the end of that Age.

* Amlaith of Fornost|Amlaith
Eldest son of E?endur and direct descendant of Isildur; he was the first King of Arthedain.
 Amlaith's younger brothers (whose names were frustratingly never recorded) were the founders of the kingdoms of Cardolan and Rhudaur.


* Amon Amarth
'Mount Doom', the name given to Orodruin when its fires awoke again after Sauron's return from N?enor.
-----
A rarely used name for Orodruin, the flaming mountain in northern Mordor where Sauron forged the One Ring.


* Amon Anwar|Anwar|Hill of Awe
'Hill of Awe'; Sindarin name of Halifirien, seventh of the beacons of Gondor in Ered Nimrais; also simply Anwar. See Eilenaer, Halifirien, Wood of Anwar.
-----
The original Sindarin name for the hill known to the Rohirrim as the Halifirien. The last of the beacon-hills of Gondor, it stood on the borders of the land of Rohan, and the secret Tomb of Elendil lay there for many centuries.

* Amon D?|Amon Din
'Silent Hill'; the easternmost of the beacon hills of Gondor in Ered Nimrais and nearest to Minas Tirith, lying to the east of the Dr?dan Forest.


* Amon Ereb|Ereb
'Lonely Hill' (also simply Ereb), between Ramdal and the river Gelion in East Beleriand.
-----
The broad, shallow-sided hill that dominated the southern plains of East Beleriand. As the highest point in that region, it had tremendous strategic importance, because it guarded the eastern passage around the Long Wall of the Andram into the southern parts of Beleriand. It was here that Denethor of the Nandor met his end in the First Battle, and much later, Caranthir fortified it to guard his escape into the south after the Dagor Bragollach.


* Amon Ethir|Spyhill|Spy Hill
'Hill of Spies', the great earthwork raised by Finrod Felagund to the east of the Doors of Nargothrond. Called also Spyhill.


* Amon Gwareth
The hill upon which Gondolin was built, in the midst of the plain of Tumladen.
-----
The hill that stood in the valley of Tumladen, within the Encircling Mountains, on which Turgon built the city of Gondolin.


* Amon Hen
The 'Hill of Sight' that stood on the western banks of the Anduin, above the Falls of Rauros, originally close to the northern borders of Gondor. It was on the slopes of Amon Hen that the Company of the Ring was broken, and from there Frodo began his lonely journey into Mordor with Sam.


* Amon Lanc
'Naked Hill'; a hill in the southern parts of Greenwood the Great. After a millennium of the Third Age had passed, Sauron came to Amon Lanc and built a stronghold there. The hill and fortress were then together called Dol Guldur, and the wood it which it stood became known as Mirkwood.


* Amon Lhaw
The Hill of Hearing in the eastern Emyn Muil.
 The Hill of Hearing that was the twin of Amon Hen, the Hill of Sight. It lay among the Emyn Muil on the eastern banks of the Anduin, above the Falls of Rauros. Though at one time it had been part of the northern borderlands of Gondor, that lay centuries in the past at the time of the War of the Ring; by then, it had long since fallen under the influence of Mordor.


* Amon Obel
A hill in the midst of the Forest of Brethil, on which was built Ephel Brandir.
-----
The fortified hill at the heart of Brethil.
 The hill around which the Forest of Brethil spread. Most of the Woodmen of Brethil dwelt there in the later First Age, within the stockade known as Ephel Brandir.


* Amon R?h|Amon Rudh
'Bald Hill', a lonely height in the lands south of Brethil; abode of M?, and lair of T?in's outlaw band.
-----
The Bald Hill that lay south of Brethil in West Beleriand. The house of M? the Petty-dwarf lay within this hill, and it was for a time the base of T?in Turambar and his outlaws.


* Amon S?|Amon Sul
'Hill of the Wind', a round bare hill in the Kingdom of Arnor (at the southern end of the Weather Hills in Eriador).
-----
The Elvish name for the hill better known by its Mannish name, Weathertop. It lay at the southern end of the Weather Hills, and at one time had a tower built on its summit that held one of the palant?i.


* Amras|Amrod
Twin-brother of Amrod, youngest of the seven sons of F?nor; slain with Amrod in the attack on E?endil's people at the Mouths of Sirion.

* Amroth
Sindarin Elf, King of L?ien, lover of Nimrodel; drowned in the bay of Belfalas.

* Anach
Pass leading down from Taur-nu-Fuin (Dorthonion) at the western end of Ered Gorgoroth..
-----
The western pass of the Ered Gorgoroth.
 A pass through the western Ered Gorgoroth, and the only southward route out of the land of Dorthonion. It was discovered by the spies of Morgoth after the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, and used by his forces as a means of entering Beleriand.


* Anad??Anad??Anadune
A name for N?enor, apparently an Ad?aic word with approximately the same meaning as 'Westernesse'.


* Anar
Quenya name of the Sun.
-----
The Sun.
 During the Years of the Trees, Valinor was lit for many thousands of years by the light of the Two Trees, Telperion the Silver and Laurelin the Gold. When these were destroyed by Melkor and Ungoliant, the World was plunged into darkness. Through the power of Nienna and Yavanna, though, Laurelin produced a single fiery fruit before it died. This golden fire was set in a vessel, and steered into the sky by the Maia Arien. The Vanyar gave it the name Anar the fire-golden: this was the origin of the Sun.
 Valinor was in the West of the World, and the so the first sunrise was in the west, not the east. Originally, Arien was to have steered Anar ceaselessly from west to east and back again, always remaining in the sky, but the Valar changed this counsel, so that each evening Anar would descend into the distant western seas, and re-emerge each morning in the east.


* Anardil (King of N?enor)|Anardil
The given name of Tar-Aldarion.
-----
At the dawning of N?enor's pride and power, Tar-Meneldur the fifth King of that island Kingdom had a son whom he named Anardil. That Anardil grew up to rule as the famous sixth King of N?enor, who allied himself with Gil-galad and founded N?enor's first footholds in Middle-earth, though he ruled under the better known name of Tar-Aldarion.


* Anardil (King of Gondor)|Anardil
The sixth King of Gondor.
-----
Anardil son of E?endil succeeded his father to become the ruler of Gondor.
 Anardil's reign over Gondor was uneventful. He is perhaps most notable as the last of Gondor's Kings to dwell exclusively in Osgiliath, since his son Ostoher was to set the precedent of the Kings spending summer in Minas Anor, the citadel later known as Minas Tirith.
 Anardil ruled Gondor for eighty-seven years, and was succeeded by his son, Ostoher.


* An?ion|Anarion
Younger son of Elendil, who with his father and his brother Isildur escaped from the Drowning of N?enor and founded in Middle-earth the N?en?ean realms in exile; lord of Minas Anor; slain in the siege of Barad-d?.


* Anarr?a|Anarrima
Name of a constellation.


* Anborn
A tracker of Ithilien.
 A Man of Gondor and Ranger of Ithilien, who tracked Gollum in the last days of the War of the Ring. His captain Faramir overruled his desire to kill the creature; if Gollum had died, Sauron would almost certainly have been victorious.


* Ancalagon
Ancalagon the Black. Greatest of the winged dragons of Morgoth, destroyed by E?endil.
-----
'Rushing Jaws', the mightiest of Morgoth's winged dragons, loosed from Angband against the host of the Valar at the end of the War of Wrath. Even that mighty army was driven back by the onset of Ancalagon and his vassals, but E?endil came through the sky in Vingilot to do battle with the dragon armada, and he was aided by Thorondor and the Eagles. They fought for twenty-four hours, until E?endil at last slew Ancalagon, who fell on the mountains of Thangorodrim and destroyed them in his ruin.

* Andustar
The western promontory of N?enor. Translated 'Westlands'.
-----
The western promontory of N?enor, separated from the Hyarnustar to the south by the wide Bay of Eldanna. The Andustar formed a very roughly rectangular region, about 150 miles west to east, and 100 miles north to south. To the east, it bordered the Forostar and Mittalmar regions, but in all other directions it was surrounded by the ocean.
 The Andustar was a generally fertile region, except along its northern coasts, where the landscape became higher and rockier, and forested by firs. Its western shores were broken by three bays, with the northernmost of these being the Bay of And?i? On the high land around this bay, the N?en?eans built the port and city of And?i? whose Lords were to be the ancestors of the Kings of Arnor and Gondor.


* Andwise 'Andy' Roper|Andwise|Andy
Sam's rope-making uncle.
-----
The son of Hobson, the Hobbit known as Roper Gamgee, and the eldest brother of Hamfast Gamgee, the Gaffer. Andwise carried on his family's Tighfield rope-making tradition, a tradition that went back at least three generations to his grandfather Hob Gammidge.
 It was Andwise's younger brother Hamfast who broke the roping tradition, and travelled instead to Hobbiton, where his distant cousin Holman Greenhand was a gardener. Thus, Andwise's brother Hamfast laid the foundations for the famous Gardner family. Of Andwise's own descendants, though, we know almost nothing, except that he had one son, named Anson.


* Anfalas
Fief of Gondor; coastal region between the mouths of the rivers Lefnui and Morthond. In Westron translated 'Langstrand'.
-----
A shoreland fief of Gondor.
 The long strip of shoreland territory that lay between the Rivers Lefnui and Morthond, bounded to the north by the Green Hills of Pinnath Gelin. Anfalas is this land's Elvish name. Its name in the Common Speech, Langstrand had the same meaning: 'long shore'.


* Anfauglir

* Anfauglith
Name of the plain of Ard-galen after its desolation by Morgoth in the Battle of Sudden Flame; translated as 'the Gasping Dust'. See Dor-nu-Fauglith.
-----

* Angainor
The chain wrought by Aul?with which Melkor was twice bound.
-----
The mighty chain with which the Valar held Melkor captive for three ages in the Halls of Mandos.


* Angband
'Iron Prison', 'Hells of Iron', the great dungeon-fortress of Morgoth in the North-west of Middle-earth.
-----
The Hells of Iron.
 Angband was a mighty fortified citadel originally constructed by Melkor in the earliest days of the world as an outlying fortress to his northern stronghold of Utumno. Utumno was destroyed by the Valar, and Melkor imprisoned in Valinor for three ages, but on his return to Middle-earth, he took Angband as the seat of his power, and raised the towers of Thangorodrim above its gates.
 Angband was beseiged by the Noldor during the early part of the First Age, but the Siege of Angband was broken at the Dagor Bragollach. It was finally destroyed by the forces of the Valar at the end of the First Age, in the War of the Wrath.
-----
Origins and History: Melkor built Angband during the Years of the Trees, originally as an outlying fortress and armoury to his great northern citadel at Utumno. It was commanded from its first construction by Sauron, the chief of Melkor's servants. Angband was built near the northwestern shores of the Great Sea in the range of the Iron Mountains, as a first defence against any attack on Melkor's realm from the Valar in Aman.
 When the Valar captured Melkor and took him in chains back to Valinor, Angband was largely destroyed and lay in ruins for many thousands of years, although beneath the ruins lay many hidden chambers in which some of Melkor's servants escaped the Valar's assault. Sauron was one of these, and the Balrogs lay hid with him in Angband's deepest vaults.
 Angband re-entered history when Melkor escaped Valinor with the stolen Silmarils: he chose the ruined fortress as his new capital, and rebuilt the Hells of Iron as a base for the dark reign he intended for the lands of Middle-earth.
 Soon after the Return of the Noldor to Beleriand, Morgoth took Maedhros F?nor's son by deceit and trickery, and hung him by the wrist from the towers of Thangorodrim above Angband. He was rescued by Fingon and Thorondor, but lost his right hand.
 The third of the great battles in the Wars of Beleriand, the Dagor Aglareb, had profound consequences for Angband. Until that time (about the year 75 of the First Age), Morgoth sent out hosts of Orcs in the hope of taking the Noldor by surprise. The Noldor, though, chased these Orcs back to the very gates of Angband, and slew them to the last creature. From then until the Dagor Bragollach in I 455, a period of almost 400 years, Angband was surrounded by the Noldor; this is the time known as the Siege of Angband.
-----
Appearance and Construction: Angband was primarily an underground fortress, at least after its initial destruction by the Valar in the Years of the Trees. Like its prototype, Utumno, it had many hidden underground chambers and vaults far beneath the earth. Its main features above ground were the three peaks of the Thangorodrim, mighty towers of ash and slag raised above Angband's gates.
 The peaks of Thangorodrim were hollow, and from them channels and chimneys ran down to the deepest pits of Angband. So, Morgoth could produce poisonous clouds and vapours, as indeed he sent against the Noldor in Mithrim during the first days after their Return.


* Angbor
Sturdy Lord of Lamedon.
 The Lord of Lamedon at the time of the War of the Ring. Famed for his fearlessness in the face of the Grey Host of the Dead, he aided Aragorn in his march to Minas Tirith. He marshalled a force from the southern lands, and rode to garrison the City of Gondor after the departure of Aragorn and the Captains of the West.


* Angelimar
Twentieth Prince of Dol Amroth, grandfather of Imrahil.


* Angerthas
The Runes.
 An Elvish term for Runic writing, said to have the literal meaning of 'long Rune-rows'. There were numerous variants, but the two principle forms were the Angerthas Daeron, used by the Elves to represent Sindarin, and the Angerthas Moria, the classical form used by the Dwarves.


* Anghabar
'Iron-delvings', a mine in the Encircling Mountains about the plain of Gondolin.


* Anglachel
The sword made from meteoric iron that Thingol received from E? and which he gave to Beleg; after its reforging for T?in named Gurthang.
-----
The mate of Anguirel.
 'Iron of the Flaming Star', the sword forged by E? the Dark Elf and borne by Beleg of Doriath. It was later reforged as T?in's black sword, Gurthang.


* Angmar
The Witch-realm ruled by the Lord of the Nazg? at the northern end of the Misty Mountains.
-----
The northern reaches of the Misty Mountains, around Carn D?, realm of the Witch-king (the Lord of the Nazg?) in the far north of the Misty Mountains. Angmar made war unceasingly with Arthedain and its allies, and eventually destroyed them, but was itself destroyed by an army of Gondor.


* Angrenost
'Iron Fortress', the Sindarin name for Isengard, the fortress of Saruman at the head of the River Isen.


* Angrim
Father of Gorlim the Unhappy.


* Angrist
'Iron-cleaver', the knife made by Telchar of Nogrod, taken from Curufin by Beren and used by him to cut the Silmaril from Morgoth's crown.
-----
'Iron-cutter', the knife made by Telchar of Nogrod and borne in the First Age by Curufin the son of F?nor. It was taken from him by Beren, who used it to cut free a Silmaril from the Iron Crown of Morgoth.


* Angrod
Noldorin prince, the third son of Finarfin, who with his brother Aegnor held the northern slopes of Dorthonion; slain in the Dagor Bragollach.
-----
The son of Finarfin and elder brother of Galadriel; he held Dorthonion with his brother Aegnor, and was lost in the Dagor Bragollach.


* Anguirel
E?'s sword, made of the same metal as Anglachel.
-----
One of a pair of iron-cutting swords forged by E?, the Dark Elf, from an iron meteorite. Anguirel's mate was Anglachel, which E? gave to Thingol in payment for leave to dwell in Nan Elmoth, and that sword went on to perform many mighty deeds - reforged as Gurthang, it was the sword that T?in used to kill Glaurung.
 Anguirel's history is far more mysterious. The only specific detail we have is that E? kept it for himself, but it was stolen by his son Maeglin. This must have happened when Maeglin and his mother Aredhel fled Nan Elmoth for Gondolin, so presumably the sword was taken to Turgon's Hidden City. What became of it after that is unknown.


* Annael
Grey-elf of Mithrim, fosterfather of Tuor.
-----
A Sindarin Elf, the foster-father of Tuor during his early years in Mithrim.


* Annatar

* Annon-in-Gelydh
'Gate of the Noldor', entrance to a subterranean watercourse in the western hills of Dor-l?in, leading to Cirith Ninniach.
-----
The hidden Gate of the Noldor.
 The Sindarin name for the lost Gate of the Noldor, found after years of searching by Tuor, and used by him to escape Hithlum and find his way into Nevrast.


* Ann?inas|Annuminas
'Tower of the West' (i.e. of Westernesse, N?enor); city of the Kings of Arnor beside Lake Nenuial; afterwards restored by King Elessar.
-----
Ancient seat of the Kings of Arnor.
 The city of the Kings of Arnor, on the shores of Nenuial. The city was founded by Elendil himself, on the shores of the northern lake Nenuial, near the sources of the Baranduin. It was the chief city of the Kings of Arnor for several centuries, and home to one of the three palant?i of the North-Kingdom.
 The available evidence suggests that the city survived for nearly a thousand years. In the early days of Arnor, it must have been one of the glories of Middle-earth. Soon after its founding, though, the numbers of the D?edain of the North began to dwindle. The population of Ann?inas seems to have fallen throughout its history, until eventually it was deserted, and the Kings removed to Fornost to the east.
 It seems likely that the people of Ann?inas were dependent on the River Baranduin for their contact with the outside world. While the Hills of Evendim surrounded the city to the west and south, the city's people could reach the other cities of the D?edain that lay along the river by boat.
 After the city's desertion, it fell into decay, but two relics of its greatness survived: its palant? and the Sceptre of Ann?inas. The palant? remained in Middle-earth for more than a millennium after the loss of its city, but was ultimately drowned with Arvedui in the cold northern seas.
 The silver Sceptre of Ann?inas was the symbol of Kingship in the North-kingdom. A very ancient thing, it was originally the rod of office of the N?en?ean Lords of And?i? Though it would have been removed to Fornost by the Kings, and eventually came to be kept by Elrond in Rivendell, it retained the name of its ancient home of Ann?inas.
 At the time of the coronation of Aragorn at the end of the Third Age, Ann?inas had lain in ruins for more than two thousand years. There are hints in The History of Middle-earth though, that Aragorn refounded the city and may even have made it his capital. No definite statement on this matter appears in the canonical works, though, so this must be considered speculation.


* Anor
An Elvish name for the Sun.
 The name for the Sun in the Sindarin language. It appears in many names, including Minas Anor, the original name for Minas Tirith, meaning 'Tower of the Setting Sun'. It is also seen in the flower-name elanor, 'sunstar', and perhaps in the title Gandalf claimed for himself on the Bridge of Khazad-d?, 'wielder of the flame of Anor'.


* Anor-stone|Stone of Anor
The palant? of Minas Anor.
 The Gondorian palant? kept at Minas Tirith, taking its name from the older title of that city, Minas Anor. This was the seeing-stone used by Denethor during the War of the Ring.


* An?ien|Anorien
Region of Gondor north of Ered Nimrais.
-----
That region of Gondor that lay at the eastern feet of the White Mountains, land under the direct control of the city of Minas Anor (later Minas Tirith).


* Apan?ar|Apanonar
'The Afterborn', an Elvish name for Men.


* Apes|Ape
Forest creatures from the southern lands.
 Creatures from the dark forests in the south of Middle-earth. Though they seem to have been unknown in the northern lands, the Orcs used their name as a favourite form of insult.


* Appledore Family|Appledore
A family name of the Big Folk of Bree. Only one member of the family appears in Tolkien's works - Rowlie Appledore, who was killed in fighting at Bree during the War of the Ring.


* Ar-Abatt?ik|Ar-Abattarik
Ad?aic name of Tar-Ardamin.


* Ar-Ad?akh?|Ar-Adunakhor
Twentieth King of N?enor, named in Quenya Tar-Herun?en.
-----
The twentieth ruler of N?enor. He turned away from the Valar and the Elves, and was the first King to take a name in Ad?aic.


* Ar-Belzagar
Ad?aic name of Tar-Calmacil.
 Tar-Calmacil was a great warrior who succeeded his father Tar-Alcarin to become the eighteenth King of N?enor. In his time, the falling away of the N?en?eans that had begun centuries earlier in the reign of Tar-Atanamir became stronger, and he was the first King whose name was translated into the native Ad?aic speech of N?enor: Ar-Belzagar. Both names apparently mean 'King Light-sword', a reference to his warlike youth.


* Ar-Gimilz?|Ar-Gimilzor|Gimilz?|Gimilzor
Twenty-third King of N?enor, persecutor of the Elendili. Named in Quenya Tar-Telemnar.
-----
The twenty-third King of N?enor, the father of Tar-Palantir and grandfather of Ar-Pharaz?, the last King. He was an enemy of the Faithful and the Elf-friends, and persecuted them during his reign.


* Ar-Inzilad?|Ar-Inziladun
Ad?aic name of Tar-Palantir.


* Ar-Pharaz?|Ar-Pharazon
'The Golden', twenty-fifth and last King of N?enor, who perished in the Downfall; named in Quenya Tar-Calion; captor of Sauron, by whom he was seduced; commander of the great fleet that went against Aman.
-----
Twenty-fifth and last King of N?enor. He assailed Mordor and brought Sauron back to N?enor as a hostage, but Sauron seduced him, and persuaded him to sail on Valinor itself. As punishment for this act, the island of N?enor sank beneath the waves of the Great Sea.


* Ar-Sakalth?|Ar-Sakalthor
Twenty-second Ruler of N?enor; named in Quenya Tar-Falassion. Father of Ar-Gimilz?.


* Ar-Zimrathon
Twenty-first ruler of N?enor; named in Quenya Tar-Hostamir.


* Aradan
Sindarin name of Malach, son of Marach.


* Arador
The grandfather of Aragorn.
 The fourteenth Chieftain of the D?edain, descended in right line from Aranarth the son of Arvedui. While still a young man by the account of the D?edain, he was captured by Hill-trolls in the fells north of Rivendell, and slain. He was succeeded by his son, who led the D?edain as Arathorn II, and was in turn succeeded by his own son, Aragorn.


* Araglas
Sixth Chieftain of the D?edain, son of Aragorn I and direct ancestor of Aragorn II Elessar.


* Aragorn I|Aragorn
A remote ancestor of Aragorn of the Fellowship of the Ring.
 The heir of Aravir, who ruled as fifth Chieftain of the D?edain for just eight short years. He met an untimely end as the prey of wild wolves, and was succeeded by his son Araglas.


* Aragorn II Elessar|Aragorn
Son of Arathorn, the thirty-ninth Heir of Isildur in the direct line; King of the reunited realms of Arnor and Gondor after the War of the Ring; wedded Arwen, daughter of Elrond. See: Elessar, Elf-stone, Estel, Strider, Thorongil.
-----
Heir of Isildur through thirty-nine generations, Chieftain of the D?edain of the North and, after the War of the Ring, King of the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor and Gondor. Called by Gandalf 'the greatest traveller and huntsman in this age of the world', Aragorn experienced many great adventures, and travelled to many distant lands, before claiming his kingship.


* Aragost
Eighth Chieftain of the D?edain, son of Arahad I and direct ancestor of Aragorn II Elessar.


* Arahad I|Arahad
Seventh of the Chieftains to rule the D?edain after the loss of Arthedain, Arahad was the son of Araglas of the line of Isildur. Early in his reign, the Watchful Peace came to an end as Sauron returned to Dol Guldur, and soon afterwards the White Council was formed. Some years later, Orcs that had been secretly establishing themselves in the Misty Mountains suddenly revealed themselves, and the roads eastward into Eriador became all but impassable. Arahad's reign lasted sixty-eight years; he was succeeded by his son, Aragost.


* Arahad II|Arahad
Tenth Chieftain of the D?edain, son of Aravorn and direct ancestor of Aragorn II Elessar.


* Arahael
The second Chieftain of the D?edain.
 Arahael was the first of Isildur's Heirs to be born after the destruction of the North-kingdom. His father Aranarth therefore gave him over to Elrond, to be fostered in Rivendell, and this became the custom of the Chieftains of the North.
 Some decades before Arahael assumed the leadership of his people, Gandalf had gone to Dol Guldur and driven its master into the east. The Witch-king, who had ravaged the realm of Arahael's grandfather Arvedui two generations before, was far to the south in Minas Morgul. So, Arahael led the D?edain during the time known as the Watchful Peace, and was untroubled by war.
 Arahael served as Chieftain of the D?edain for seventy-one years. He was succeeded by his son Aranuir.


* Araman
Barren wasteland on the coast of Aman, between the Pel?i and the Sea, extending northward to the Helcarax?
-----
The narrow coastlands of Aman, north of Valinor, that lay east beyond the mountain-fence of the Pel?i.


* Aranarth
First of the Chieftains of the D?edain.
 The elder son of King Arvedui of Arthedain, who would have become King himself in turn, if not for the destruction of his father's Kingdom by the Witch-king of Angmar. When Aranarth was still a young man by the reckoning of his people, the Witch-king's armies swept into Arthedain and overran it. Fornost was taken, but the King and his son escaped. Arvedui fled into the north, but Aranarth, like most of his people, escaped westwards across the River Lh? into Lindon.
 At Aranarth's urging, C?dan sent a ship into the north to recover his father, but it never returned. It was later learned that the ship had rescued Arvedui, but had been lost with him aboard in the icy northern seas. So Aranarth inherited the leadership of the scattered and diminished northern D?edain, but he took the title Chieftain, rather than King, since his father's realm was lost.
 The D?edain were to have their revenge soon after, though, with the arrival of the Gondorian prince and general E?nur, the son and heir of E?nil II. He sailed into Lindon, and then marched eastwards to rout the armies of Angmar. Of Aranarth's activities during this campaign we know nothing, but all available evidence suggests that he was in Lindon when E?nur arrived there, and so it seems very likely that he marched with E?nur's forces and saw the defeat of his ancient enemy with his own eyes.
 Aranarth served as Chieftain of the D?edain for 131 years. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Arahael.


* Arandor
The 'Kingsland' of N?enor.
 The important central region of N?enor, around the island's capital at Armenelos. It was almost landlocked, but it met the Sea in the far east, where the great port of R?enna lay. From there, a road ran westward to Armenelos and then on to the Meneltarma on the western borders of Arandor.


* Arandur
A title literally meaning 'King's Servant', 'Minister'. This was the actual title of the Stewards of Gondor - 'Steward' is an English approximation of the Quenya Arandur.


* Aranel
'Noble Elf', a title of Dior Eluch?, Thingol's Heir.


* Aranr?h|Aranruth
'King's Ire', the name of Thingol's sword. Aranr?h survived the ruin of Doriath and was possessed by the Kings of N?enor.


* Arantar
The fifth King of Arnor.
 The fifth King to rule over the North-kingdom, son of Eldacar, grandson of Valandil and great-grandson of Isildur himself. Though his reign spanned nearly a century, we have no records of events that took place in that time. He was succeeded as King by his son Tarcil.


* Aranuir
The third of the Chieftains of the D?edain, the son of Arahael and great-grandson of Arvedui Last-King. He was the direct ancestor of Aragorn Elessar through thirteen generations.


* Aranw?Aranwe
Elf of Gondolin, father of Voronw?
-----
The father of Voronw?the mariner.
 An Elf of the House of Fingolfin. Though not much is known about him for sure, he seems to have been a nobleman of Gondolin (at least, his name means 'noble one', and his son Voronw?came from Turgon's Hidden City).


* Aranwion
The surname of Voronw?
 The surname of Voronw?in Gondolin. Aranwion is a patronymic, meaning simply 'son of Aranw? (his father's name Aranw?means 'noble one').


* Araphant
Arthedain's penultimate King.
 At the time Araphant inherited his kingdom from his father Araval, Arthedain was already in desperate straits. The Witch-king of Angmar had been beleaguering the northern lands for nearly five hundred years, and Arthedain's resistance was beginning to fail.
 The one hope that Araphant had left was to renew the ancient bond with the South-kingdom of Gondor, which was at that time suffering losses itself at the hands of the Wainriders. He forged an alliance with King Ondoher of Gondor, and sealed it with the wedding of his son Arvedui to Ondoher's daughter F?iel. Araphant's foresight failed to bring help to his kingdom, though, since Gondor itself was under sustained attack and could send no troops to his aid.
 Four years after the alliance was made, Ondoher fell in battle with the Wainriders, and the South-kingdom was left Kingless. Araphant's heir Arvedui made a claim to the Kingship of Gondor, which would have reunited the two Kingdoms, but Steward Pelendur moved the Gondorians to reject it.
 Araphant ruled Arthedain for seventy-three years. He was succeeded by his son Arvedui, who would be the last of the northern Kings.


* Araphor
The ninth King of Arthedain.
 The son of Arveleg I came early to the throne of Arthedain. While he was still in his youth (probably no more than eighteen years old), the Witch-king of Angmar launched a mighty invasion of his kingdom, that came close to destroying it. Araphor's father Arveleg fought in the defence of the Tower of Amon S?, and his early death in that battle brought Araphor to the throne.
 Records of the events of this time are incomplete, but it seems that the Witch-king laid siege to the royal city of Fornost. The young Araphor went to war with aid from C?dan and the Elves of Lindon, and succeeded in relieving the siege and driving back the forces of Angmar.
 After Araphor's defeat of Angmar, there is no record of further warfare during his long reign. Nonetheless, he ruled a diminished and dwindling people; the wars of his youth had seen the Northern D?edain come close to destruction. Rhudaur was now a tributary state to Angmar, and the D?edain of Cardolan were all but extinct.
 Araphor ruled Arthedain for one hundred and eighty years, and was succeeded by his son, named for Araphor's heroic grandfather Argeleb, who ruled as Argeleb II.


* Arassuil
The eleventh Chieftain to lead the Northern D?edain, the son and heir of Arahad II. His time as Chieftain saw great troubles grow in the Northlands. Orcs from the Misty Mountains boldly invaded the western lands, and were fought back by Arassuil's Rangers and the household of Elrond. Arassuil was succeeded as Chieftain by his son Arathorn I.


* Aratan
The second son of Isildur, slain with his father and his brothers Elendur and Ciryon in the Disaster of the Gladden Fields.


* Aratar
'The Exalted', or High Ones of Arda: the eight Valar of greatest power.
-----
The highest of the Powers.
-----
"Among [the Valar] Nine were of chief power and reverence; but one is removed from their number, and Eight remain, the Aratar, the High Ones of Arda..."
(Valaquenta)
-----
The eight greatest of the Valar: Manw? Varda, Ulmo, Yavanna, Aul? Mandos, Nienna and Orom? Though Manw?was held to be the High King of Arda, all these eight were held in equal reverence, and were said to possess a majesty that surpassed even the other Valar.
 It seems clear from the quotation above that the Aratar were originally nine, and included Melkor (probably as the greatest of them), but he was removed from this 'order' after his rebellion.


* Arathorn I|Arathorn
Twelfth of the Chieftains of the D?edain.
 The son of Chieftain Arassuil, who led the Northern D?edain in his turn. The great-great-grandfather of Aragorn Elessar, he ruled in the North for sixty-four years, and died an untimely death. He was succeeded by his son Argonui.


* Arathorn II|Arathorn
The son of Chieftain Arador of the D?edain, and a descendant through many generations of Isildur himself. Of Arathorn's early life, little is known. He first appears in annals at the age of fifty-six, seeking the hand of Gilraen as his wife. Gilraen at that time was just twenty-two years old, and though the wedding was opposed by her father D?hael, she became Arathorn's wife.
 The following year, Arathorn's father Arador was slain by Trolls, and Arathorn took on the title of Chieftain of the D?edain. Gilraen bore him a son, who was given the name Aragorn. Aragorn would not know his father for long - when he was just two years old, Arathorn went hunting Orcs, and was shot through the eye by an arrow. After Arathorn's loss, Gilraen took their son to Rivendell to be fostered by Elrond.
 Arathorn II served as Chieftain of the D?edain for just three years. He was succeeded by his only son, who would become Chieftain Aragorn II, and in time King Elessar of the Reunited Kingdom of the D?edain.


* Araval
The thirteenth King of Arthedain.
 The son of Arveleg II was born into a time of war and strife. At the time of his birth, his father's realm of Arthedain had been under threat from the eastern land of Angmar for more than four hundred years.
 Araval, too, played his part in the war with Angmar. The Lord of the Rings tells us nothing of his career, but The History of Middle-earth hints (in volume 12) that he was a diplomat and a warrior. In alliance with the Elves of Lindon and Imladris, he won at least one important victory over the Witch-king of Angmar. We are also told that he attempted the recolonisation of Cardolan, though this was prevented by the evil beings, the wights, sent there by the Witch-king some two centuries before.
 In the end, though, Araval's bravery counted for little. His grandson Arvedui, who was born in Araval's lifetime and just thirteen years after his great victory, was to see the final destruction of the kingdom of Arthedain.
 Araval ruled Arthedain for seventy-eight years, and was succeeded by his son Araphant.


* Aravir
The fourth Chieftain of the D?edain.
 The son of Aranuir, who led the D?edain of the North during the closing years of the Watchful Peace. It was Aravir, it seems, who devised the name 'Aragorn'; he gave it to his son, who succeeded him as Chieftain Aragorn I. The Aragorn of the The Lord of the Rings was his distant descendant, Aragorn II of the line of Isildur.


* Aravorn
The ninth Chieftain to rule the D?edain since the loss of Arthedain. He led the Rangers for sixty-six years, and was succeeded by his son, who became Chieftain Arahad II. Aravorn was a direct ancestor of Aragorn II Elessar, through seven generations.


* Araw
The Sindarin form of the name of the Vala Orom?


* Archet
Forest village of Bree-land.
 The most remote of the settlements of the Bree-land, set among the trees on the edge of the Chetwood, somewhat to the east of Bree itself.


* Ard-galen
The great grassy plain north of Dorthonion, called after its desolation Anfauglith and Dor-nu-Fauglith. The name means 'the Green Region'. See Calenardhon (Rohan).
-----
The wide green plain that lay between the northern fences of Beleriand and Morgoth's fortress of Angband; it was destroyed by flame in the Dagor Bragollach and renamed Anfauglith.


* Arda
'The Realm', name of the Earth as the Kingdom of Manw?
-----
The World.
 In the language of the Elder Days, 'Arda' signified the World and all that is in it. Arda was created through the Music of the Ainur to be a dwelling place for the Children of Il?atar (that is, Elves and Men).
 Originally a flat world, the continents were surrounded by a mighty ocean, Ekkaia or the Encircling Sea, and separated by Belegaer, called the Great Sea. In the First Age, the regions to the north and west of Middle-earth (the bay of Forochel) were occupied by the country of Beleriand, but this was destroyed during the tumults of the War of Wrath.
 In the Second Age, the isle of N?enor was raised in the Great Sea for the Edain to dwell on. This island existed through most of the Second Age, but was destroyed in the Downfall of N?enor as a result of the pride of the N?enorean people in defying the Ban of the Valar and sailing to Aman in the west.
 After the Downfall, the shape of Arda was changed, and it was made 'bent' (or 'round' as we should say in modern terms). Aman was taken out of the world, and could only be reached by the Elves, following the straight road that was granted to them. As Aman was taken away from Arda, new lands and continents were created. From the late Second Age onwards, the World began to take the shape that we know today.


* Aredhel Ar-Feiniel|Ar-Feiniel
'Noble Elf', the sister of Turgon of Gondolin, who was ensnared by E? in Nan Elmoth and bore to him Maeglin; called also Ar-Feiniel, the White Lady of the Noldor, the White Lady of Gondolin.
-----
The White Lady of the Noldor.
 Sister of Fingon and Turgon, Aredhel was accounted one of the noblest of the Noldor. She dwelt with Turgon in Gondolin, but straying from the city she was ensnared by E? the Dark Elf and taken as his wife. She bore him a son, Maeglin, and when Maeglin was full-grown they escaped together to Turgon's city. E? followed them, however, and attempted to slay his son with a poisoned dart. Aredhel sprang to take the dart, however, and died of its poison.


* Argeleb I|Argeleb
The seventh King of Arthedain.
 The son of Malvegil, who sought to reunify the lost kingdom of Arnor under his Kingship. Since the D?edain in Cardolan and Rhudaur had dwindled in numbers, Argeleb tried to refound Arnor around his own kingdom of Arthedain. He failed, largely through the machinations of the Witch-king of Angmar, and instead an open war broke out in which Argeleb himself was slain.


* Argeleb II|Argeleb
Tenth King of Arthedain, son of Araphor, and direct ancestor of Aragorn II Elessar.


* Argonath
'King-stones', the Pillars of the Kings. Two mighty statues, carved in the likenesses of Isildur and An?ion, that guarded the passage of the Great River Anduin. They marked the ancient northern border of Gondor.


* Argonui
The thirteenth Chieftain of the D?edain, who inherited the title when his father Arathorn I was slain by wolves. The end of his rule saw the coming of the Fell Winter to the north. He was succeeded by his son Arador, who was the grandfather of Aragorn Elessar.


* Arien
A Maia, chosen by the Valar to guide the vessel of the Sun.
-----
Called the Sun-maiden, Arien was a spirit of fire who seems originally to have belonged to the Maiar of V?a. When the Valar set the Sun in the sky, Arien was given the task of guiding its course.


* Arkenstone
The Heart of the Mountain of Erebor.
-----
"It was like a globe with a thousand faces; it shone like silver in the firelight, like water in the sun, like snow under the stars, like rain upon the Moon!"
(The Hobbit 12, Inside Information)
-----
The great jewel discovered beneath the roots of Erebor by Thr?n I soon after the establishment of the Dwarf-kingdom there, and prized by his descendants as the Heart of the Mountain. The Dwarves used all their skill to work the gem into a shimmering multi-faceted jewel that not only shone by its own pale light, but when light fell upon it, the stone '... changed it into ten thousand sparks of white radiance shot with glints of the rainbow.' (The Hobbit 13, Not at Home). It was a heavy gem, small enough for Bilbo to hold in one hand, yet not so small that he could close his own small hand around it.
 In the centuries after its discovery, the Arkenstone became an heirloom of the Kings of Durin's Folk. It was carried away into the Grey Mountains by Thr?n's son, and in time brought back to the Great Hall of Thr?n under the Mountain by his descendant Thr?. When Smaug sacked Erebor, the Arkenstone was lost to the Dwarves of Durin's Folk - it lay among Smaug's booty in the halls of Erebor.
 Many years later, when Thorin led a band of Dwarves to recover their ancient city, their companion Bilbo Baggins discovered the Arkenstone, and kept it for himself. Later, when the Lake-men and Wood-elves came to demand their own shares of Smaug's treasure from Thorin, Bilbo delivered the Arkenstone to them to bargain with. In the ensuing Battle of Five Armies, though, all enmities were forgotten, and Bard of Dale placed the Heart of the Mountain on the breast of Thorin in his tomb beneath Erebor. So, nearly a thousand years after its discovery by Thr?n I, the Arkenstone was buried once more in the depths beneath the Lonely Mountain.


* Armenelos
The royal city of N?enor.
 The mighty city in the central regions of N?enor, where the island's Kings dwelt.


* Arminas
Noldorin Elf, who with Gelmir came upon Tuor at Annon-in-Gelydh, and afterwards went to Nargothrond to warn Orodreth of its peril.
-----
With Gelmir, one of two messengers sent by C?dan to Nargothrond in the First Age. Their message, that the bridge before the doors of Nargothrond should be demolished, was ignored, leading to the destruction of that citadel by Glaurung.


* Arnach
Pre-N?en?ean name of Lossarnach.


* Arnor
'Land of the King', the northern realm of the N?en?eans in Middle-earth, established by Elendil after his escape from the Drowning of N?enor.
-----
The North-kingdom of the D?edain.
 Founded by Elendil in the last years of the Second Age, Arnor was the great kingdom of Men in the north of Middle-earth. It lay between the Misty Mountains in the east, and the Blue Mountains on the borders of Lindon in the west, and encompassed the area where the Shire would be founded many years later. Its capital, and the seat of its Kings, was at Ann?inas on Lake Nenuial.
 Elendil fell in the Siege of Barad-d? in II 3441, and his eldest son Isildur, who would have taken the rulership, was lost two years later as he journeyed back from the southlands with his three eldest sons. These were also slain by Orcs at the Disaster of the Gladden Fields. Isildur's youngest son Valandil, however, had not gone to the war, and was kept safe in Rivendell; he was accounted the third King of Arnor, though Isildur had never taken the throne.
 The tenth and last King of Arnor was E?endur. After his death in III 861, his three sons each made claims of succession. This led to the break-up of Arnor into three separate but related kingdoms; Arthedain, Cardolan and Rhudaur. E?endur's eldest son, Amlaith of Fornost, became King of Arthedain, and is considered the true heir to the line of Isildur.


* Arod
The steed of Legolas and Gimli.
 A light horse of Rohan, whose name means simply 'swift'. After the loss of his original rider, Arod was given to Legolas by ?mer, and he served his new rider faithfully throughout the War of the Ring. For much of this time, Arod carried two riders, since Legolas was often accompanied by his friend Gimli.


* Aros
The southern river of Doriath.
-----
A river of eastern Beleriand that rose in the northern lands around Himring, and flowed into the Sirion at Aelin-uial.


* Arossiach|Fords of Aros
The Fords of Aros, near the north-eastern edge of Doriath.
-----
The crossing of the Aros.
 The ford on the upper reaches of the River Aros, where the long and perilous road through Nan Dungortheb crossed eastward into the lands of West Beleriand.


* Arroch
The horse of H?in of Dor-l?in.


* Artamir
Elder son of Ondoher King of Gondor; slain in the battle with the Wainriders.
-----
The lost heir of Ondoher.
 The elder son and heir of King Ondoher of Gondor, who marched with his father to war with the Wainriders. Ondoher's force met with a surprise assault beneath the Black Gate of the Morannon, where the King and his son Artamir were slain. It was later discovered that Artamir's younger brother Faramir had also ridden to war, against the laws and customs of Gondor, and had himself been lost in the battle, leaving Gondor without a King.
 A political crisis ensued, in which Arvedui the northern King of Arthedain pressed a strong claim to the Crown of Gondor. Arvedui's claim was rejected by Steward Pelendur and the Council of Gondor, who instead gave the Kingship to E?nil, the victorious Captain who also belonged to the Royal House. E?nil's line was short-lived, however, and ended with the presumed loss of his son E?nur in Minas Morgul.
 The loss of Artamir was a turning point in the history of Middle-earth. Had he not perished, the line of Kings would almost certainly have survived the coming crisis and lasted into the third millennium of the Third Age. A thousand years later, Aragorn would have found Minas Tirith ruled not by a Steward but by a legitimate King, so preventing him from claiming the Crown himself. The unknown Wainrider who cut down Artamir, then, unknowingly paved the way for the reunification of Arnor and Gondor more than a thousand years later.


* Artanis
Name given to Galadriel by her father.
-----
The 'father-name' of Galadriel.
 It was the custom of the Elves that a child's father should give a name to his newborn son or daughter, and so when Finarfin's youngest child was born, his only daughter, he chose the name Artanis, meaning 'noble woman'. As an adult, Artanis took a different name, a name in the Sindarin tongue meaning 'radiant garland' - Galadriel.


* Artano
'High-smith', name given to himself by Sauron in the Second Age. See Annatar, Aulendil.


* Arthad
One of the twelve companions of Barahir on Dorthonion.


* Arthedain
One of the three kingdoms into which Arnor was divided in the ninth century of the Third Age; bounded by the rivers Baranduin and Lh?, extending eastwards to the Weather Hills, and with its chief place at Fornost.
-----
Last Realm of the Northern Kings. One of three kingdoms formed from the breakup of Arnor.
 The westernmost region of the lost realm of Arnor; when that land was divided between the sons of E?endur, Arthedain became a kingdom in its own right, and was ruled by E?endur's eldest son Amlaith and his decendants.


* Arth?ien|Arthorien
Region between the rivers Aros and Celon in the east of Doriath.


* Arvedui|Last-king
'Last-king' of Arthedain, drowned in the Bay of Forochel.
-----
Son of Araphant, the fifteenth and last king of Arthedain. When the forces of Angmar overran the last remnant of the North-kingdom, Arvedui fled into the far north, but perished in the Bay of Forochel. His eldest son, Aranarth, became the first Chieftain of the D?edain.


* Arvegil
The eleventh King of Arthedain.
 The heir of Argeleb II of Arthedain. During his father's reign, Arvegil saw events that would shape the history of Middle-earth, including the foundation of the Shire. He was eighty-three years old (no great age for one of the D?edain) when the Great Plague came out of the south and ravaged Eriador, but the seat of the Kings at Fornost in the north was little affected.
 Arvegil lived for one hundred and ninety years, precisely the same age as his great descendant Aragorn, as is noted in the Appendices to The Lord of the Rings. By the standards of his own ancestors, though, this was an early death. Of all the northern Kings before Arvegil - excepting those slain in battle - only two had lived less than two hundred years: his father Argeleb II and his grandfather Araphor.
 Arvegil ruled Arthedain for seventy-three years, and was succeeded by his son, who ruled as Arveleg II.


* Arveleg I|Arveleg
The eighth King of Arthedain.
 The beginning and the end of the Arveleg's reign were forged in battle and in war. He became King when his father Argeleb I went to war with the newly allied lands of Rhudaur and Angmar, and was slain. Arveleg made an alliance of his own, with the Men of Cardolan and the Elves of Lindon, and struck back at the eastern lands.
 These two allied forces seem to have cancelled one another out. For more than fifty years, Arveleg was able to hold a defensive line stretching east from Weathertop, through which Angmar could not break. Rivendell did not fall behind this frontier, it seems, and suffered a siege at this time.
 At last the balance broke: Angmar gathered its forces and breached the frontier. Crossing the River Hoarwell, its armies marched westward and surrounded Weathertop, destroying its Tower and sending the troops of Arthedain in retreat back to Fornost. Arveleg died in that assault, and his young son Araphor came to the throne.
 Arveleg I ruled Arthedain for fifty-three years, and was succeeded by his son, Araphor.


* Arveleg II|Arveleg
The twelfth King of Arthedain.
 The son and heir of Arvegil, who ruled Arthedain in a time of war with the northern land of Angmar. He was succeeded by his son Araval.


* Arvernien
The coastlands of Middle-earth west of Sirion's mouths.
-----
The coastlands of Beleriand to the north of the Bay of Balar.


* Arwen Evenstar|Arwen
Daughter of Elrond and Celebr?n; wedded to Aragorn; Queen of Gondor.
-----
Noble Queen to Aragorn II Elessar.
 Daughter of Elrond, Arwen forsook her Elven immortality to wed Aragorn II Elessar and become Queen of the Reunited Kingdom. Arwen means 'Noble maiden'.


* Ascar
The most northerly of the tributaries of Gelion in Ossiriand (afterwards called Rathl?iel). The name means 'rushing, impetuous'.
-----
Last resting-place of the treasures of Doriath.
 The northernmost of the rivers that flowed through Ossiriand, along the northern bank of which lay the Dwarf-road from the Blue Mountains. It was renamed Rathl?iel ('Goldenbed') after the sinking of the treasure of Doriath there.


* Asfaloth
The horse of Glorfindel, who bore Frodo Baggins to safety at the Ford of Rivendell.


* Asgon
Man of Dor-l?in, who aided T?in's escape after the slaying of Brodda.


* Ash Mountains|Ashen Mountains
A name of the Ered Lithui, the northern mountain-fence of Mordor.


* Ashes|Ash
Spear-wood of the Rohirrim.
 Tall, straight, grey trees common in northern lands, and found throughout Middle-earth. The spears of the Rohirrim were made from their wood, as was Gandalf's staff.


* Asphodel
Pale flowers of the woodland.
 Yellow and white flowers found by Frodo and Sam in Ithilien.


* Astaldo
'The Valiant', name of the Vala Tulkas.


* Astron
The fourth month of the year according to the Shire Calendar, approximately equivalent to modern April.


* Atalant?Atalante
A name in Quenya for N?enor after its Downfall, meaning simply 'The Downfallen' (see Akallab?h).


* Atanalcar
The youngest of the four children of Elros Tar-Minyatur. His elder brother Vardamir N?imon became the second King of N?enor.


* Atanatar I|Atanatar
Tenth King of Gondor, son of Turambar and direct descendant of Elendil's second son An?ion.


* Atanatar II Alcarin|Atanatar
Sixteenth and greatest of the Kings of Gondor, son of Hyarmendacil I and direct descendant of Elendil's second son An?ion. During his rule, Gondor reached its height, and his surname Alcarin ('Glorious') marks this.


* Atanat?i|Atanatari
'Fathers of Men'; see Atani.


* Atani|Atan
'The Second People', Men (singular Atan). Since in Beleriand for a long time the only Men known to the Noldor and Sindar were those of the Three Houses of the Elf-friends, this name (in the Sindarin form Adan, plural Edain) became specially associated with them, so that it was seldom applied to other Men who came later to Beleriand, or who were reported to be dwelling beyond the Mountains. But in the speech of Il?atar the meaning is 'Men (in general)'.
-----
An Elvish name for Men, and especially the Men of the Three Houses of the Edain.


* Athelas|As? Aranion|asea aranion
An Elvish name for Kingsfoil.
 The plant also known as Kingsfoil or As? Aranion. Its leaves had healing properties, but by the end of the Third Age knowledge of its use was all but lost in Middle-earth.


* Athrad Angren|Ethraid Engrin
Sindarin name (also in plural form Ethraid Engrin) of the Fords of Isen.


* Aul?Aule
A Vala, one of the Aratar, the smith and master of crafts, spouse of Yavanna; maker of the Dwarves.
-----
The maker of Middle-earth.
 One of the Aratar, the greatest of the Valar, Aul?was the Vala concerned with the substance of Arda; rock and metal. As his name suggests, he was also the builder and inventor of the Valar. He constructed Angainor, the chain of Melkor, and the vessels of the Sun and Moon.
 In anticipation of the coming of the Children of Il?atar, Elves and Men, Aul?went so far as to create a race of his own, the Dwarves. Il?atar blessed them with life, but would not suffer them to be born before the Elves, so Aul?set them to sleep in Middle-earth until the Elves had awoken.
 When the Elves came to Valinor, the Noldor became fascinated by the lore of Aul? and became his students. F?nor was his greatest pupil, and from him learned the craft to make the Silmarils.


* Aul?n|Aulean
Of or pertaining to Aul?


* Aulendil
'Servant of Aul?, name given to himself by Sauron in the Second Age. See Annatar, Artano.


* Avall??Avallone
Haven and city of the Eldar on Tol Eress?, so named, according to the Akallab?h, 'for it is of all cities the nearest to Valinor'.
-----
The haven of the Elves who lived on the isle of Tol Eress?, off the eastern shores of Aman.


* Avari|Avar
'The Unwilling', 'Those who Refused the Summons', the name given to all those Elves who refused to join the westward march from Cuivi?en. See Eldar and Dark Elves.
-----
'The Unwilling'; those of the Elves who refused the summons of the Valar to dwell in Valinor, and remained in the dark wilds of Middle-earth. Some of the Avari, it is said, were corrupted by Melkor in ancient days to become the progenitors of the race of Orcs.


* Avathar
'The Shadows', the forsaken land on the coast of Aman south of the Bay of Eldamar, between the Pel?i and the Sea, where Melkor met Ungoliant.
-----
A narrow land in the south of Aman, between the Pel?i mountains and the sea. In ancient times it was the dwelling place of Ungoliant.


* Awakening of Men
The stirring of the first Men, in the far eastern land of Hild?ien at the beginning of the First Age.


* Azagh?|Azaghal
Lord of the Dwarves of Belegost; wounded Glaurung in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, and was killed by him.
-----
Lord of Belegost in the Blue Mountains; slain by Glaurung in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad.


* Azanulbizar
The valley below the East-gate of Moria where in Third Age 2799 was fought the great battle that ended the War of the Dwarves and Orcs.
-----
The deep-shadowed valley of the Dimrill Dale.
 The Dwarves' name for a valley between two arms of the Misty Mountains, called Nanduhirion by the Elves and the Dimrill Dale by Men. Azanulbizar was of vital importance in Dwarvish history: it was here that Durin first looked on the waters of Kheled-z?am and was inspired to found Khazad-d?. It was here, too, millennia later, that Dwarves destroyed the armies of the Orcs to bring an end to the War of the Dwarves and Orcs.


* Azog
Orc of Moria; slayer of Thr?, and slain himself by D?n Ironfoot in the Battle of Azanulbizar.
-----
Chieftain of the northern Orcs.
 An orc-chieftain of Moria, who started the War of the Dwarves and Orcs when he slew Thr?. He was himself slain by D?n Ironfoot in the Battle of Azanulbizar, and was succeeded by his son Bolg.
 Of Azog's origins we know little; he was the chief of the Orcs of Moria, and apparently the most important Orc of the northern lands. The average lifespan of an Orc is unknown, but it is conceivable that he was one of those sent to Moria by Sauron in about III 2480. He had one son that we know of, Bolg, who succeeded him after his death.
 Azog entered history in the year III 2790 due to King Thr?'s desire to revisit and perhaps refound the lost realm of Khazad-d?, in whose mighty ruins Azog dwelt. Azog captured and slew Thr?, and branded his hewn head with his own name, AZOG.
 When news of this reached Thr?'s heir Thr?n, he was greatly angered, and mustered a force of Dwarves to seek revenge on Azog. So began the War of the Dwarves and Orcs: the Dwarves hunted Azog, and many battles were fought beneath the earth. After nine years of war, the climactic Battle of Azanulbizar was fought before the gates of Moria itself.
 King Thr?n and his son Thorin were in that battle (it was here that Thorin gained the surname Oakenshield). Near the end of the battle, Azog himself emerged and fought with Thr?n's cousin N?n and, after breaking N?n's neck, his young son D?n. Though only 32 years old, D?n swept the head from Azog's shoulders, and helped to win the day.
 The Dwarves made no attempt to press their advantage, though, because D?n had glimpsed Durin's Bane during his battle, and warned the Dwarves not to attempt to enter Moria. Azog's underground dominions in the north, though greatly reduced in the War, fell to his son Bolg, who held them for more than 150 years until he too met his end at the Battle of Five Armies.


* Bag End|Bag-End
Dwelling at Hobbiton in the Shire of Bilbo Baggins, and later of Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee.
-----
The great smial beneath Hobbiton Hill.
 A large and comfortable hobbit-hole, well-known as the home of Bilbo Baggins and his heir, Frodo. Its round green door opened into a large, well-appointed hobbit-hole that took up much of the Hill above Hobbiton. In the tradition of hobbit-holes, all the rooms at Bag End were on the same level, and there were many of these; '... bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars, pantries (lots of these), wardrobes ([Bilbo] had whole rooms devoted to clothes), kitchens, dining-rooms...'


* Baggins Family|Baggins
A family of Hobbits of the Shire.
-----
An old and important family of Hobbiton.
 An old family of the Shire found mostly in the Hobbiton region of the Westfarthing. They had always been an important family in the Shire, and gave rise to the two most important Hobbits of the Third Age, Bilbo the Ring-finder and Frodo the Ring-bearer.


* Bagshot Row
The row of hobbit-holes that were delved into Hobbiton Hill beneath Bag End. They were destroyed in the War of the Ring, and replaced by a new row called, simply, New Row.


* Balan
The name of B?r the Old before he took service with Finrod.


* Balbo Baggins|Balbo
The earliest recorded member of the Baggins family; great-grandfather of Bilbo the Ring-finder.


* Balchoth
An Easterling people akin to the Wainriders whose invasion of Calenardhon in Third Age 2510 was crushed at the Battle of the Field of Celebrant.
-----
Fierce Easterling enemies of Gondor.
 A race of Easterlings under the sway of Dol Guldur, who lived in the lands east of the forest of Mirkwood. In the later Third Age, they attempted an invasion of Gondor, but were repulsed by Cirion and Eorl.


* Bald Hill
The hill of Amon R?h, that rose up out of the plainlands south of the Forest of Brethil. It was so named because its peak rose up in bare rock, except for the growth of red seregon there. The hill was originally a settlement of the Petty-dwarves (who called it Sharbhund), and latterly home to T?in and his outlaw band.


* Baldor
The prideful son of Brego and grandson of Eorl the Young. He tried the Paths of the Dead, though he had been told that the way was shut to him. His bones were found long years afterward by Aragorn and his company.


* Balin
A Dwarf of Durin's Folk; he accompanied Gandalf, Thorin and Bilbo on the Quest of Erebor, and later led an ill-fated attempt to reclaim Moria.


* Balrog|Balrogs
'Demon of Might', Sindarin form (Quenya Valarauko) of the name of the demons of fire that served Morgoth.
-----
Dread Servants of Melkor.
 The Balrogs were spirits of fire seduced by Melkor in the beginning of Arda, and who dwelt in his northern fortress of Utumno. During the First Age, the Balrogs were the most feared of Morgoth's forces after the dragons.
 In appearance, the Balrogs were man-like, but fire streamed from them, and they were swathed in dark shadows. They carried whips of flame and induced great terror in friends and foes alike.
 In the War of Wrath, Morgoth was assailed by the forces of the Valar. Most of the Balrogs were destroyed in that War, but some few escaped over the Blue Mountains and lay hid in Middle-earth. Durin's Bane, the creature that drove the Dwarves from Moria, was one of these.
-----
The Balrogs Before the First Age: The Balrogs were in origin Maiar, of the same order as Sauron or Gandalf. Melkor corrupted them to his service in the distant past of the World, in the days of his splendour. They were originally gathered by him in his ancient fastness of Utumno during the time of the Lamps of the Valar. When this fortress was destroyed by the Valar, at least some fled and lurked in the pits of Angband (whether any of the original Balrogs were slain in the Valar's attack on Utumno is not known).
-----
Balrogs in the First Age: When Melkor and Ungoliant escaped from Valinor three ages later with the Silmarils, the Balrogs were still to be found in the ruins of Angband. Ungoliant entrapped Melkor in her webs, demanding the Silmarils for herself, but the Balrogs issued from their hiding-place and rescued their lord.
 The Balrogs were apparently first encountered by the Elves during the Dagor-nuin-Giliath in the first year of the First Age. After the great victory of the Noldor over Morgoth's Orcs, F?nor pressed on towards Angband, but the Balrogs came against him. He was mortally wounded by Gothmog, Lord of Balrogs. Though his Sons beat off the demons of fire, F?nor died of his wounds soon after, and his spirit departed for the Halls of Mandos.
-----
The Appearance and Nature of Balrogs: Balrogs were spirits of fire - their hearts were of fire, we are told, and they carried whips of flame. They could, however, shroud themselves in darkness and shadow. The Balrog that Gandalf fought in Moria, for example, at first gave no hint of his fiery nature apart from the flames that issued from his nostrils.


* Ban of the Valar
The ban placed by the Valar on the N?en?eans, that they should not sail so far west from their island that they could not see its coasts. It was the breaking of the Ban by Ar-Pharaz? that led to the Downfall of N?enor.


* Banakil
A Westron name for the Hobbits, meaning literally 'halfling'.


* Bandobras 'Bullroarer' Took|Bandobras
Victor of the Battle of Greenfields.
 The son of either Thain Isengrim II or Isumbras III (sources differ) of the Took line, Bandobras was famous for averting a goblin invasion of the Shire at the Battle of Greenfields, and personally slaying the goblins' leader, Golfimbul.


* Bane of Glaurung|Glaurung's Bane
A title given to T?in, and carved on his tomb in the Elvish form dagnir glaurunga, after he slew the dragon Glaurung.


* Banks
A common Hobbit family name, found not only in the Shire, but also in Bree.


* Bar-en-Danwedh
'House of Ransom', the name that M? the Dwarf gave to his dwelling on Amon R?h when he yielded it to T?in.
-----
The House of Ransom: the hidden house of M? the Petty-dwarf within Amon Rudh, given over to T?in and his band of outlaws in ransom for M?'s life.


* Bar-en-Nibin-noeg
'House of the Petty-dwarves', M?'s dwelling on Amon R?h.


* Bar-erib
A stronghold in Dor-C?rthol, not far south of Amon R?h.


* Barach
A forester of the People of Haleth in the story of 'The Faithful Stone'.


* Barad-d?|Barad-dur
'The Dark Tower' of Sauron in Mordor.
-----
"... wall upon wall, battlement upon battlement, black, immeasurably strong, mountain of iron, gate of steel, tower of adamant... Barad-d?, fortress of Sauron."
(The Fellowship of the Ring II 10, The Breaking of the Fellowship)
-----
The mighty shadow-shrouded stronghold of Sauron in the Second and Third Ages.
 Other Names: The Dark Tower, Lugb?z.
-----
The First Building of Barad-d?: The first building of Barad-d?, when Sauron was first came to Mordor, took six hundred years to complete. Soon after, Tar-Minastir of N?enor sent a fleet to Middle-earth, and Sauron's forces were driven out of the western lands that they had roamed at will to that time. Barad-d? could not be approached by the N?en?eans, however, and Sauron was able to consolidate his power and extend it into the east.
 In II 3262, Sauron left his Dark Tower to travel to N?enor with the vast forces of Ar-Pharaz?; he returned after the Downfall of N?enor in II 3319. The Last Alliance besieged Barad-d? in II 3434, and the Tower was taken and destroyed by the forces of Elendil and Gil-galad, who both perished in the siege, in II 3441. Though Barad-d? was destroyed, its foundations were left in place.
-----
The Second Building of Barad-d?: For much of the Third Age, Sauron's stronghold was not in Mordor, which was ruled in his stead by the Nazg?. Rather, the Dark Lord dwelt in the south of Mirkwood at Dol Guldur. In III 2941, the White Council sent their forces to drive him from Mirkwood, and he withdrew to Mordor once again. There, he began the rebuilding of the Dark Tower. Given the time taken in its first building, this cannot have been fully complete at the time of the War of the Ring in III 3019.
 Barad-d? was constructed as much through the personal power of Sauron as through stone and mortar; when the One Ring was destroyed in Orodruin, this power was lost and the Tower destroyed forever.
-----
The Appearance of Barad-d?: The most complete description we have of Barad-d? is that given in the quote above. We know, then, that it was black, and constructed mainly of metal. 'Adamant' usually refers to diamond, but it is hard to imagine Sauron adding diamond towers to his dark fortress - in this context, it probably has the more general meaning of 'hard, unbreakable substance'.
 From the steel gate of the Tower, a causeway ran out into the plain of Gorgoroth, across a mighty bridge. We also know that lava from Mount Doom was channeled back across that plain to Barad-d?.
 Tolkien probably leaves details of the Tower's construction vague intentionally, as it was hidden by a cloud of shadow and darkness at all times. The only characters in The Lord of the Rings to actually see Barad-d? were Frodo and Sam as they journeyed to Mount Doom: '... rising black, blacker and darker than the vast shades amid which it stood, the cruel pinnacles and iron crown of the topmost tower of Barad-d?...'.
 The 'topmost tower of Barad-d?' seems to have been the place where Sauron dwelt. At least, the Window of the Eye, from which the Lidless Eye stared out across Middle-earth, was located there.


* Barad Eithel
'Tower of the Well', the fortress of the Noldor in Eithel Sirion.
-----
The fortress at the well of Sirion.

* Baragund
Father of Morwen the wife of H?in; nephew of Barahir and one of his twelve companions in Dorthonion.
-----
A descendant of B?r the Old, who was the father of Morwen Eledhwen and thus the grandfather of T?in Turambar. Nephew of Barahir and one of his twelve companions on Dorthonion. Little is known of his life, but he seems to have been slain by the forces of Morgoth (at least, he is 'avenged' in the War of Wrath).

-----
The rescuer of Finrod Felagund.

* Barahir (Steward of Gondor)|Barahir
The eighth Ruling Steward of Gondor.
 Barahir's father was Hador, a famously long-lived Man who ruled Gondor as its Steward for no less than one hundred and seventeen years. According to the best sources we have, Barahir was born in the twelfth year of his father's rule, meaning that he succeeded Hador at the age of one hundred and five. Given Barahir's great age, it is not surprising that his rule, and that of his son Dior, were brief ones.
 Barahir held the office of Steward during the waning years of the Watchful Peace. Both he and his son Dior, then, enjoyed rules free of troubles. Barahir's grandson was Denethor, the son of his daughter R?n, who was a young noble of just twenty at the time Barahir became Steward. It was Denethor who was destined to rule Gondor at the time that war erupted on its borders, more than sixty years after Barahir's death.
 Barahir ruled as Steward for seventeen years, and was succeeded by his son Dior.


* Baran
The elder son of B?r the Old, who took up the leadership of the House of B?r after his father's departure to service in Nargothrond.


* Baranduin
'The long gold-brown river' in Eriador, flowing into the Sea south of the Blue Mountains; in the Shire called the Brandywine.
-----
The river called 'Brandywine' by the Shire-hobbits.
 The Elvish name for the river that rose at Lake Nenuial in the far north, and flowed south and west to reach the Great Sea above Eryn Vorn. For part of its length, it formed the eastern boundary of the Shire, and there the Hobbits turned its name to the more familiar 'Brandywine'.


* Baraz
A Dwarvish name for one of the three Mountains of Moria, also called Caradhras or Redhorn. 'Baraz' seems to be an abbreviation of a fuller name, Barazinbar.


* Barazinbar
The Dwarvish name for the cruel red-sided mountain known to the Elves as Caradhras and to Men as the Redhorn.


* Bard I|Bard
The Bowman of Lake-town.
 A descendant of Girion the Lord of Dale, Bard slew the dragon Smaug and refounded Dale under the Lonely Mountain.


* Bard II|Bard
The great-grandson of Bard the Bowman.
 The son of Brand and heir to the Lordship of Dale. His father was slain in the Battle of Dale, and Bard was forced back to Erebor, where he was besieged with his ally Thorin III for seven days.

-----
The haunted hills of Tyrn Gorthad.
 The downs to the east of the Shire that held the ancient burial grounds of Men. During the time of the realm of Angmar, evil things came to dwell among the barrows, and some were still to be found there at the time of the War of the Ring.


* Barrow-wights|Barrow-wight
Evil spirits dwelling in the burial-mounds on the Barrow-downs.
-----
Evil spirits out of Angmar.
 Evil spirits sent to dwell in the Barrow-downs by the Witch-king of Angmar during his wars with the remnant of Arnor, and who remained there long after the realm of Angmar itself had vanished from the world.


* Barrows|Barrow
The mounds of Tyrn Gorthad.
 Earthworks and burial chambers made by Men in ancient days. In the Third Age, they lay within the bounds of Arnor, and later of Cardolan, and the D?edain used them to bury their dead. The Witch-king of Angmar, though, sent evil spirits to inhabit the Barrow-downs, and they became a place of horror.


* Bats|Bat
Flying creatures of the night, traditionally associated with the forces of Morgoth and of Sauron. They were most famous in Middle-earth for taking the part of the Goblins during the Battle of Five Armies.


* Battle of Azanulbizar
The revenge of the Dwarves against Azog.
 The battle that ended the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, in which N?n and Azog were both lost along with many on either side, but the Dwarves won the day.


* Battle of Bywater
The last battle of the War of the Ring.
 The confrontation that took place between the Shire-hobbits and Sharkey's invading ruffians. Under the leadership of Peregrin Took, Meriadoc Brandybuck and Tolman Cotton, the Hobbits succeeded in trapping Sharkey's Men between the high banks of the Bywater Road, and managed to defeat them.


* Battle of Dagorlad
The climactic battle of the Second Age.
 The decisive battle of the War of the Last Alliance, in which the last great alliance of Elves and Men, led by Gil-galad and Elendil, faced the forces of Sauron. The Battle took place on a wide and dusty plain before the entrance to Mordor, and many who took part were lost in the marshes that bordered the battlefield on the west. There was great loss on either side, but Sauron was defeated and fled back to Barad-d?. After the Battle was won came another seven long and bitter years of siege, but Sauron was finally defeated and the Second Age came to an end.
 The Battle of Dagorlad was one of the greatest Middle-earth had ever seen. The original name of the field where it took place - if it had one - is now forgotten: that region was known afterwards simply as Dagorlad, 'Battle Plain'.


* Battle of Dale
Battle of the War of the Ring in which Sauron's northern army defeated the Men of Dale and the Dwarves of Erebor.
-----
Sauron's assault on Dale and Erebor.
 A battle that took place during the War of the Ring, in Dale and Erebor. Brand of Dale and D?n Ironfoot were both lost in the battle, and their respective forces besieged in the Lonely Mountain. The sons of these two lords, Bard II and Thorin III, were eventually able to break the siege and defeat the forces of Sauron.


* Battle of Five Armies
The great battle before the gates of Erebor.
 Since the ending of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, and the Dwarves' ultimate victory at the Battle of Nanduhirion, the Orcs had nursed a hatred of that race. In the year III 2941, the year of Bilbo Baggin's journey to the Lonely Mountain, those events lay more than one hundred and forty years in the past. Travelling through the Misty Mountains, Bilbo, Thorin and their companions were captured by a colony of the Orcs that infested those regions. With Gandalf's help they escaped, but not before killing several of their captors, including their leader the Great Goblin.
 The loss of the Great Goblin at the hands of a band of Dwarves inflamed the bitter memories of the Orcs' War with the Dwarves. Under the command of Bolg, whose own father Azog had been killed at Nanduhirion, all the armies of the Orcs of the Misty Mountains, and their allies the wolves and bats, began to gather and plan their revenge.
 Oblivious to these events, Bilbo and the Dwarves continued their journey eastward. They achieved their quest to recover Erebor, but in doing so they earned the anger of Thranduil, and indirectly caused the destruction of Lake-town. Thranduil's Wood-elves joined with the Lake-men, and they marched north to claim a share of Smaug's treasure in recompense. In response, Thorin called on his cousin D?n, who set out with his own army from the Iron Hills.
 So the scene was set for a confrontation between the Wood-elves and Lake-men on the one side, and the Dwarves of Thorin and D?n on the other. Already the first arrows had been shot when a dark cloud was seen coming out of the north - the bats that heralded the orc-armies of Bolg. The Elves, Men and Dwarves quickly forgot their differences in the face of this new threat, and battle was joined on the slopes of Erebor and the valley beneath. The battle was ferocious, and as it raged, it was joined by others - Eagles out of the Misty Mountains, and even Beorn himself in the shape of a monstrous bear.
 By nightfall the Orcs were defeated, but not without great loss. Thorin himself was slain, making a bold attack against the bodyguard of Bolg, and with him fell his young nephews F?i and K?i. Bolg was dead, too, crushed by Beorn, and the goblins of the northern mountains were scattered or destroyed.


* Battle of Fornost
The climactic battle amid the ruins of the North-kingdom.
 In the year III 1974, the kingdom of Arthedain was destroyed, and with it the last realm of the Northern D?edain. The armies of Angmar and its allies overran the northern lands, capturing the capital of the D?edain at Fornost, and King Arvedui fled into the icy north. It seemed at that time that the Witch-king's victory was complete.
 In the following year, though, the tide turned, though too late to save the remnant of the North-kingdom. The ships of a great fleet sailed into the harbours at Mithlond, carrying a force of Gondorian warriors sent north under the command of the great general E?nur. To that army joined the Elves of Lindon and the remnant of the D?edain, and they marched east to avenge the loss of Arthedain.
 They met the Witch-king's armies not at Fornost itself, but on the plains westward towards Lake Evendim. Aided by E?nur's military skill, and a force sent out of Rivendell led by Glorfindel, the armies of the D?edain and Elves had utter victory, and Angmar's armies were swept away. The Witch-king himself fled into the dark of the falling night, and Glorfindel famously prophesied that he would not fall by the hand of man, as later proved true in the War of the Ring.
 The Battle of Fornost shaped the future history of Middle-earth in many important ways. Its most significant effect could hardly have been guessed at the time: it robbed Gondor of its Kings. When the Witch-king fled south, and came at last to Mordor, he did not forget his defeat at the hands of E?nur. Many years later, E?nur became the King of Gondor, and the Witch-king challenged him to single combat. He refused, but seven years later the challenge was made again, and this time E?nur accepted. Riding to Minas Morgul, he was taken by the Nazg? and never heard of again. He was the last King to rule the South-kingdom until after the War of the Ring nearly a thousand years later.


* Battle of Greenfields
Bandobras Took's defeat of invading Orcs.
 A battle fought in the Shire's Northfarthing in the year III 2747, the only battle to be fought within the borders of the Shire before the War of the Ring. An invading band of Orcs from Mount Gram were led into the Shire by their chief Golfimbul; they were defeated, and Golfimbul was slain, by Bandobras Took, otherwise known as 'Bullroarer'.


* Battle of Nanduhirion
The end of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs.
 The climactic battle in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, also called the Battle of Azanulbizar and the Battle of the Mines of Moria, that took place below of the East-gate of Moria in the winter of III 2799.
 Nine years before the battle, the Dwarf-king Thr? had been murdered by Azog the goblin in Moria. That event triggered a furious backlash from the Dwarves, who assembled their armies and, in their quest for revenge against Azog, began the systematic destruction of the Orcs of the Misty Mountains. Eventually, the armies of the Dwarves came up against the last stronghold of the Orcs, and hiding place of Azog, old Moria itself.
 The battle was fought in the valley of Nanduhirion beneath Moria's gates. The Orcs were more numerous, and held the higher ground at the head of the valley. The Dwarves under Thr?n II, though, were better equipped, and were rallied late in the battle by the arrival of reinforcements, commanded by Thr?n's cousin N?n. There was great loss on both sides, but eventually the Dwarves had the victory; D?n Ironfoot - just thirty-two years old at the time - slew Azog on the steps of Moria.


* Battle of Sudden Flame
A name for the Dagor Bragollach, and its literal translation.


* Battle of the Camp
The victory of E?nil II of Gondor over the Wainriders in Ithilien in Third Age 1944.
-----
The final desctruction of the Wainriders.
 At the end of the second millennium of the Third Age, the realm of Gondor came close to its destruction. The Wainrider people from the east made an alliance with the Haradrim, and a dual attack on Ithilien was launched. While the Wainriders assaulted Ithilien from the north, the armies of the Haradrim crossed the Poros and invaded South Ithilien.
 The northern assault of the Wainriders was met by the King of Gondor himself, Ondoher, with his two sons Artamir and Faramir. The Easterlings swept through Gondor's defence, cutting down the King and his heirs and routing his army. Their victory complete, and Gondor defenceless before them, the Wainriders paused in North Ithilien to celebrate their conquest.
 Unknown to the victorious Wainriders, their allies in the south had met with much less success. Beyond hope, the Gondorian Captain E?nil had led Gondor's Southern Army to victory over the Haradrim, destroying their army in South Ithilien, to the north of the Poros. Then E?nil turned north.
 The feasting Wainriders suddenly found their success reversed, as E?nil appeared with his Southern Army, reinforced by fleeing members of Ondoher's defeated northern troops. E?nil's army descended on the unprepared Wainriders, driving many of them into the swamplands of the Dead Marshes. That eastern people, for so long a dreaded enemy of Gondor, never challenged her again, and the battle where E?nil won his success was named after the Wainrider camp where it had taken place: the Battle of the Camp.

-----
Gondor's disastrous first battle with the Wainriders.
 A battle fought in III 1856, in which the armies of Gondor and their allies the Northmen faced the invading Wainriders. The battle was a disaster for Gondor; King Narmacil II was lost, as was Marhari the lord of the Northmen. After the battle, all of Gondor's eastern possessions fell under control of the Wainriders, who remained a constant threat for nearly another century.


* Battle of the Powers

* Bay of And?i?Bay of Andunie|And?i?Andunie
Northernmost of the three bays of the Andustar.
 The northernmost of the three bays that ran along the western coasts of the Andustar in N?enor. The greatest of the three, its shores were no more than a narrow shelf of land from which steep cliffs rose up. Beneath these cliffs at its eastern end was the famous haven of And?i? There are suggestions that there may have been a second haven on this bay, too, named Almaida.


* Bay of Balar|Balar
The great bay in the southern shores of Beleriand into which the river Sirion flowed. Destroyed in the War of Wrath at the end of the First Age.
-----
The bay at the Mouths of Sirion.
 The great ocean inlet to the south of Beleriand, in which lay the Isle of Balar, and into which the River Sirion flowed.
 The Bay was formed in the cataclysms that accompanied the Battle of the Powers, long before the First Age, and was said to have been the greatest bay of the sea on the shores of Middle-earth. On its northern coasts lay Arvernien and the Mouths of Sirion, where the Exiles of Gondolin dwelt in the last years of the First Age, and from where E?endil set out on his voyage to the Undying Lands. Its eastern coastlands were dominated by the great unpeopled forests of Taur-im-Duinath.
 Far out in the Bay lay the Isle of Balar, where C?dan the Shipwright dwelt with his people after the loss of the Havens of the Falas. There was great friendship between C?dan and the Exiles at the Mouths of Sirion, and in the late First Age, the Bay must have seen much traffic between the Isle and the Mouths.
 Just as it had been created out the tumults of a war of the Powers, the Bay was destroyed, with the rest of Beleriand, in the War of Wrath between the Valar and Morgoth at the end of the First Age.


* Bay of Belfalas|Belfalas

-----
The great western bight of N?enor.
 The wide bay in the western part of N?enor, between the promontories of Andustar to the north and Hyarnustar to the south. It was fed by the River Nunduin? and its mouth was more than a hundred miles across, making it by far the largest bay in the shores of N?enor.
 From N?enor's earliest days, the bay was associated with the Eldar of Tol Eress?, who dwelt west of N?enor in the Undying Lands. The port of Eldalond?- 'Elf Haven' - stood at the mouth of Nunduin?where it emptied into the bay, and the name Eldanna itself means 'towards the Eldar'.

 The name, at least according to Peregrin Took, of a notably tall and handsome Ent. He was caught in a burning spray sent up by Saruman from beneath the Circle of Isengard, but his fiery end brought his fellow Ents to the peak of their destructive anger.


* Beeches|Beech
Broad and tall trees that grew throughout Middle-earth, and especially in its northern regions. The most famous beech-forest of all was Neldoreth in Doriath. H?ilorn, the three-trunked tree in which L?hien was imprisoned, was perhaps the greatest beech that had ever grown.

The fifteenth Ruling Steward of Gondor.
 The son of H?in II, who succeeded his father to become Gondor's fifteenth Ruling Steward. His twenty-seven year rule was free of incident, or at least no annals of his time have come down to us. He was succeeded in turn by his son Orodreth.


* Belecthor II|Belecthor
The twenty-first Ruling Steward of Gondor.
 The son of Steward Beregond, who succeeded his father to rule Gondor during the twenty-ninth century of the Third Age. He is noted as the last of the line of Stewards to live past his one hundredth year. Nonetheless, he is most remembered in history because of his death, which also saw the death of the White Tree in the courts of Minas Tirith. Belecthor was succeeded by his son Thorondir, who left the Dead Tree standing in place.


* Beleg (King of Arthedain)|Beleg
The second King of Arthedain, who inherited the throne from his father Amlaith of Fornost, the founder of that Kingdom. His name means 'great' or 'large', which may be a reference to his stature (although he may simply be named for the famous Elf of the First Age who shared this name, Beleg Strongbow).
 Beleg's reign saw two events that would have a huge impact on Middle-earth's history, but whose importance wasn't fully recognized at the time. The first of these was the arrival across the Misty Mountains of a strange race of beings: similar to Men, but far shorter and with hairy, bootless feet. The D?edain called them periannath, 'halflings', and they were the first Hobbits to enter the western lands.
 The second historic event was the descent of a strange shadow on Greenwood the Great. This was wholly mysterious at first, but before the end of Beleg's reign, the Wise had discovered that its source was at Dol Guldur in the southern part of the Forest, whose name came to be changed to Mirkwood in these times. It was not discovered until long after Beleg's time that his reign had seen the return of Sauron himself, the first move in a game that would end in the War of the Ring nearly two thousand years in the future.
 Beleg ruled Arthedain for eighty-one years, and was succeeded by his son Mallor.

-----
'The Great Sea'; the mighty ocean that lay between Middle-earth in the east and Aman in the west, in the midst of which the island kingdom of N?enor lay during the Second Age.


* Belegorn

-----
Outlaw ancestor of E?endil the Mariner.
 Father to R?n and so great-grandfather of E?endil the Mariner; he lived with the outlaw band of Barahir in Dorthonion, and was slain there by the creatures of Morgoth.


* Beleriand
The name was said to have signified 'the country of Balar', and to have been given at first to the lands about the mouths of Sirion that faced the Isle of Balar. Later the name spread to include all the ancient coast of the Northwest of Middle-earth south of the Firth of Drengist, and all the inner lands south of Hithlum and eastwards to the feet of the Blue Mountains, divided by the river Sirion into East and West Beleriand. Beleriand was broken in the turmoils at the end of the First Age, and invaded by the sea, so that only Ossiriand (Lindon) remained.
-----
The Country of Balar.
 Subcontinent in the northwest of Middle-earth, bounded to the north and east by mountain chains, and to the south and west by the Great Sea, Beleriand and the lands to the north were the setting for much of the Silmarillion. Originally, the name 'Beleriand' applied only to the country around the Bay of Balar, but as time passed the name came to be given to the entire land. In the final battle that saw the ultimate defeat of Morgoth, Beleriand was broken and destroyed - only parts of Ossiriand in the east remained, to be renamed Lindon in later ages.


* Belfalas

* Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo
The Ring-finder.
 Head of the Baggins family, he dwelt alone at Bag End, Hobbiton, until Gandalf involved him in the Quest of Erebor in III 2941, and so drew the Hobbits into the great affairs of the end of the Third Age. During his journey to the Lonely Mountain, Bilbo came upon the One Ring in an orc-hold of the Misty Mountains.
 Bilbo's records of his travels, and those of his heir Frodo, were compiled into the Red Book of Westmarch, and became the basis of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.
-----
Life in the Shire, III 2890 - III 2941: The only son of the wealthy and respectable Bungo Baggins and Belladonna Took, Bilbo grew up at Bag End, which his father had excavated in Hobbiton Hill. He seems to have visited his mother's family at Great Smials, for he remembered Gandalf's firework displays there.
 Bilbo's father Bungo died in 2926, and his mother Belladonna in 2934, after which Bilbo lived alone at Bag End for seven years until a fateful morning in the spring of 2941, when his pleasant, uneventful life was disturbed by the arrival of Gandalf.
-----
Bilbo and the Quest of Erebor, III 2941: More than a hundred and fifty years before Gandalf disturbed Bilbo in his garden that spring morning, the dragon Smaug had descended in flame on Erebor, the Lonely Mountain, an ancient kingdom of the Dwarves far to the east of the Shire. Those Dwarves that survived scattered throughout the northern lands, and many, led by Thorin, the rightful heir to the kingdom, travelled into the west and settled in the Blue Mountains near the borders of the Shire. Now, with Gandalf's aid, Thorin had begun to plot his revenge on Smaug.
 Gandalf convinced Thorin that a Hobbit should accompany his party, both because of the Hobbits' natural stealth, and because he wanted to involve them in the wider world, as a preparation against the coming darkness. He chose Bilbo largely because of his Took inheritance, but he later suggested that Bilbo might in some sense have been 'fated' to go on the Quest.
 So it was that on an evening at the end of April 2941, Gandalf returned to Bilbo's house with Thorin and his twelve companions, and the Quest of Erebor was begun.

* Boromir (Steward of Gondor)|Boromir
The eleventh Ruling Steward of Gondor, son of Denethor I.
 Like the Boromir of The Lord of the Rings, the ancient Boromir was also a powerful warrior. It was while his father ruled Gondor that the race of the Uruk-hai first appeared, and Osgiliath was attacked and invaded. Boromir went to war and drove the enemy back from Ithilien for a while, but he sustained poisoned wounds in that war.
 Boromir's Morgul-wounds wracked him with pain and shortened his life. He lived only seventy-nine years, a fraction of the usual lifespan for one of his line. When he succeeded his father, his Stewardship was to last no more than twelve years, but it paved the way for the historic rule of his famous and illustrious son Cirion.

The family was founded by Gorhendad Oldbuck who, claiming the Eastmarch of the Shire (Buckland), changed his family name to Brandybuck. Probably the most famous member of the family was Meriadoc Brandybuck, who was part of the Company of the Ring.


* Brandywine
The eastern border-river of the Shire.
 The name given by Hobbits to the river the Elves called Baranduin; its source was at Lake Nenuial in the north, and it flowed southwestwards to reach the Great Sea near Eryn Vorn. For part of its length it formed the eastern border of the Shire.


* Brandywine Bridge

* Bree-folk
The Men and Hobbits who inhabited the village of Bree and its surrounding lands.


* Bree-hill
The most prominent point in the Bree-land, on the slopes of which stood the villages of Bree itself (to the west) and Staddle (to the east).


* Bree-hobbits
The Hobbits native to Bree and the lands around; their interaction with Men (who also lived in the Bree-land), made them more open to the outside world than their parochial cousins in the Shire.
 Bree itself was a very ancient township of Men. The first Hobbits came there from the east in about the year 1300 of the Third Age, making Bree the only place in the world where Hobbits and Men lived together side by side. Most of the Hobbits of the Bree-land lived in Staddle, a village on the southeastern slopes of the Bree-hill, but some also dwelt in Bree itself, living on the hill above the houses of Men.
 It was three hundred years after Hobbits first arrived in Bree that two Fallohides, Marcho and Blanco, led a group of colonists westward to found the Shire. The Bree-hobbits, therefore, tended to look down somewhat on their cousins in the Shire, referring to them as 'Colonists' and 'Outsiders'. The Hobbits of Bree claimed to have originated most Hobbit customs, and certainly it was thought that they were the ones who first discovered the properties of pipe-weed.
 At the end of the Third Age, the Bree-hobbits still occasionally travelled west to the Shire, but they rarely ventured further than Buckland or the Eastfarthing, those parts of the Shire that were closest to their home.
 In The Lord of the Rings I 9; At the Sign of the Prancing Pony, Tolkien gives us a list of the more prominent Hobbit families living in the Bree-land at the time of the War of the Ring; Banks, Brockhouse, Longholes, Mugwort, Sandheaver, Tunnelly and Underhill. There were also Hobbits by the name of Banks living in the Shire, and Underhill was a hamlet of Hobbiton, but we can do no more than speculate on the links between these families and regions.


* Bree-land
The land around the Bree-hill, the chief township of which was Bree itself, but which also comprised the villages of Staddle, Combe and Archet.


* Bregalad
The 'hasty' Ent known to the Hobbits as 'Quickbeam', who befriended Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took during the Entmoot that preceded the Ents' attack on Isengard. Bregalad later played an important role in that attack himself.

-----
Also called the Loudwater, the river that rose in the Misty Mountains east of Rivendell, and joined the Mitheithel (Hoarwell) to form the River Gwathl?or Greyflood.


* Bucca of the Marish|Bucca
First of the Shire-thains.
 The end of the second millennium of the Third Age was a time of crisis for the Hobbits of the Shire. The northern lands of Middle-earth were aflame with war. The armies of Angmar, of Arthedain, of Cardolan, Rhudaur and latterly Gondor marched across the lands that had been the northern realm of Arnor. Most of the Shire-hobbits went into hiding, though some few marched to the service of Arthedain, within whose borders the Shire lay, but they never returned.
 At last, peace returned: the kingdoms of the D?edain fell one by one, and then the victorious Witch-king of Angmar was himself defeated by a revenging army of Gondor. The Hobbits returned to their old lives, but the loss of Arvedui, the last king of Arthedain, left them leaderless.
 After four years had passed since the end of the great wars, the Hobbits decided to take a leader for themselves. They chose one Bucca of the Marish, who was granted the title Thain of the Shire, and led the Shire-hobbits to peace and prosperity.
 No more is known of Bucca's life, but his legacy remained until the time of the War of the Ring and beyond. At that time, more than twelve hundred years after his Thainship, the Masters of Buckland still proudly claimed descent from Bucca the first Thain.


* Buck Hill
A hill overlooking the village of Bucklebury in Buckland, deeply burrowed with the smials that made up Brandy Hall, the ancestral home of the Brandybuck family.


* Buckland
The Eastmarch of the Shire.
-----
Origin and History: Seven hundred and forty years after the founding of the Shire, Gorhendad Oldbuck crossed the River Brandywine from the Eastfarthing and started the building of Brandy Hall in Buck Hill, in a land hitherto unpopulated by Hobbits. As Gorhendad's family grew, the Hall also expanded, and soon there was a flourishing community in the land between the River and the Old Forest.
 From that time, Buckland was ruled by the Brandybucks, as Gorhendad renamed his family, who were given the title 'Masters of Buckland'.
 The village of Bucklebury, lying close by Buck Hill, was considered Buckland's chief village, but the expanding population meant that many other villages soon grew up in the region, the largest of which were Newbury, Crickhollow and Standelf. The growing power of the Master of Buckland gained respect from those close by in the Eastfarthing, too; the lands of the Marish between Stock and Rushey also acknowledged themselves under the sway of Buck Hall.
 The Bucklanders soon found themselves threatened by the strange trees of the Forest, and so built a vast hedge, the High Hay, stretching twenty miles along the eastern border of their land. This was not the only danger to threaten Buckland - in III 2911, the year of the Fell Winter, the Brandywine froze and Buckland was invaded by white wolves.
 Buckland was also the childhood home of Frodo Baggins, who returned here on his journey to Rivendell in III 3018. He bought a house in Crickhollow, and claimed that he would be living there, but instead entered the Old Forest through the old Hay Gate, and left the Eastmarch of the Shire.
-----
Culture: Although similar in many ways to other Hobbits, the Bucklanders did have certain peculiarities. Due no doubt in part to the Fallohidish blood of the Brandybucks, the Hobbits of Buckland were somewhat more adventurous than their cousins in the Shire (while still conservative by the measure of many other races in Middle-earth). They enjoyed boating, an activity frowned upon by Shire-hobbits, and some of them could even swim.
 When the Bree-folk ventured to the Shire, Buckland was their usual destination (though some ventured as far as the Eastfarthing), and so was rather more cosmopolitan (in Hobbit terms) then the rest of the land.
 Living under constant danger from the Old Forest, the Bucklanders were hardier and more suspicious than the usual Shire-hobbit. They were organised to deal with danger (through the famous Horn-call of Buckland), and they kept their doors locked at night, which was unusual in the Shire.


* Buckland Gate
The North Gate of the Bucklanders.
 Leaving the Shire across the Brandywine Bridge, a traveller would come to the northern end of the High Hay, where it ran beside to the road to meet the River Brandywine. In the Hedge at this point was a guarded gate that led to Buckland, the Eastmarch of the Shire.


* Bucklanders
The inhabitants of Buckland on the eastern borders of the Shire, the Bucklanders acknowledged the Master of Buckland as their leader. The Brandybucks, descendants of Gorhendad Oldbuck who founded Buckland, were considered the most important family of the Bucklanders.
 The Brandybucks had a strong Fallohidish strain in their blood, it is said, and this made them more adventurous than many of their more conservative neighbours in the Shire. They did not share the Shire-hobbits' fear of water, for example, and the Bucklanders' boats where often seen on the Brandywine River that bordered their land.
 On the eastern border of Buckland lay the dangerous Old Forest, and the constant threat of the dark trees made the Bucklanders somewhat hardier than typical Hobbits.


* Bucklebury
The chief village of Buckland, lying in the shadow of Buck Hill, seat of the Master of Buckland, on the banks of the River Brandywine.


* Bucklebury Ferry

 A town of the Shire, lying close to Hobbiton on the borders of the Westfarthing, near the East Road.


* Bywater Road
The road to Bywater and beyond.
 The road that left the main East Road a little to the west of the Three-Farthing Stone, leading to the village of Bywater from which it took its name.

The road itself carried on into the west, in the direction of Little Delving.


* Cabed-en-Aras|Deer's Leap
Deep gorge in the river Teiglin, where T?in slew Glaurung, and where Nienor leapt to her death; translated 'the Deer's Leap'. See Cabed Naeramarth. The 'Deer's Leap'; a narrow point in the Ravines of Teiglin. It was here that T?in Turambar slew the dragon Glaurung.


* Cabed Naeramarth
'Leap of Dreadful Doom', name given to Cabed-en-Aras after Nienor leapt from its cliffs.


* Cair Andros
Island in the river Anduin north of Minas Tirith fortified by Gondor for the defence of An?ien.
-----
The 'Ship of Long-foam'.
 A large river-island in the Anduin, to the east of the land of An?ien. It was held in defence against Mordor by Gondor to prevent crossings of the Great River, though these defences were breached during the War of the Ring.
 The island itself was long and narrow, a little over ten miles in length. At its northern end, sharp rocks split the waters of the Anduin in a bubbling foam that gave the island its name. Cair Andros was covered with trees for much of its length.
 Strategically, the island was of immense importance: apart from the bridge at Osgiliath, it was the only practical means for an army from the east to cross the Anduin into Gondor's heartlands. The Gondorians took this risk seriously. Amon D?, the first of the Beacon-hills, was set up originally to warn the citizens of Minas Tirith if Cair Andros was ever breached.
 Gondor took steps to fortify the island, too, but the history of these fortifications is difficult to establish. We know that it was 'manned' at the time of King Ondoher's fall in III 1944, but whatever defences were in place at that time were apparently abandoned, since Denethor's great-grandfather T?in II found it necessary to fortify the island again in about the year III 2900.
 The Gondorian defences fell on 10 March III 3019. On the same day that the Witch-king rode from Minas Morgul with the armies that would besiege Minas Tirith, Sauron released a smaller force (though still numbering more than 6,000 Orcs and Men) from the Morannon. They overwhelmed the defenders of Cair Andros, and used the island to cross into An?ien. It was this northern force that blocked the eastward progress of the Rohirrim as they rode to Gondor's aid, though after the Battle of the Pelennor, the Rohirrim chased them down and pushed them back out of An?ien.
 They retreated to Cair Andros, and apparently held the island for some days. In his march on Mordor, Aragorn released a small group of soldiers from his main army to retake the island if necessary, and hold it. They must have succeeded, since the last we hear of the island of Cair Andros, its moorings were used by the ships of Gondor, as glimpsed by Frodo after completing his Quest.

* Calembel
The township on the River Ciril.
 A town in the Gondorian region of Lamedon. It stood above the fords of the River Ciril, where the road from Erech crossed that river and passed on eastward. It was here that Aragorn and the host of the Dead camped during their journey to Pelargir during the War of the Ring.

* Calmacil
The father of R?endacil II.
 The younger brother of Narmacil I, who succeeded his childless brother as King of Gondor.

* Calmindon
The 'Light-tower' on Tol Uinen in the Bay of R?enna.

The 'Empty-handed', a title given to Beren when he returned to Thingol's halls from the Quest of the Silmaril. He had achieved the Quest set him by Thingol - a Silmaril was in his hand, but that hand had been bitten from his arm by Carcharoth the Wolf, still holding the Jewel.


* Cape Balar|Balar

* Captain of Despair
One of the many titles of the nameless Lord of the Nazg?, used during his final battle, the assault on Minas Tirith near the end of the War of the Ring.


* Captain of the Southern Army
A military title of E?nil.
 Soon after his accession to Gondor's throne, King Ondoher realized that his kingdom's northern enemies, the Wainriders, had made an alliance with her old southern foe, the Haradrim. To counter this double threat, Ondoher divided Gondor's army into two parts; a larger Northern Army and a smaller Southern Army. The Northern Army he led himself; the Captaincy of the Southern Army he gave to his distant cousin E?nil.
 As Ondoher had foreseen, the Wainriders and Haradrim launched a joint attack on Gondor, in the year III 1944, and Gondor's two Armies marched through Ithilien to the defence of the South-kingdom. Ondoher's northern force was all but destroyed by the Wainriders, but E?nil led his lesser Army to a great victory over the Haradrim. Turning north, the Southern Army reunited with the remnant of the Northern, and together they fell on the Wainriders at the Battle of the Camp. E?nil's victories as the Southern Army's Captain would ultimately earn him the Kingship of Gondor itself.


* Captains of the West

* Caradhras
The Redhorn, the Cruel.
-----
"... Caradhras rose before them, a mighty peak, tipped with snow like silver, but with sheer naked sides, dull red as if stained by blood."
(The Fellowship of the Ring II 3, The Ring Goes South)
-----
Called the Redhorn, one of the mightiest peaks in the Misty Mountains, beneath which lay the Redhorn Pass attempted by the Nine Walkers on the Quest of Mount Doom.

* Carnen
'Redwater', river flowing down from the Iron Hills to join the River Running.
-----
The long river known as the Redwater.
 A river that rose in the Iron Hills, far to the north and east of the known parts of Middle-earth. Its winding course took it southwards for more than two hundred miles, until its waters emptied into the Celduin (the River Running) and were carried on southwards to the Sea of Rh?.
 The river's name, Carnen, is a direct Elvish equivalent of its Mannish name, the Redwater. Both are very likely a reference to its source in the Iron Hills, since rivers whose sources lie among iron deposits have water with a very distinctive red-orange colour.


* Carnil
A red star created by Varda in preparation for the coming of the Elves.


* Carrock
A stony eyot in the upper reaches of the River Anduin, to the north of the Old Ford. See Ford of Carrock.


* Castamir
The Usurper of Gondor.
 A Gondorian noble, the great-grandson of the King Calmacil. When Eldacar became King in Gondor, there was popular unrest because his mother Vidumavi belonged to the Northmen, and so he carried only half-Gondorian blood. Castamir took advantage of this unrest to launch a rebellion, and he succeeded in deposing Eldacar and sending him into exile. For ten cruel years he ruled Gondor, but Eldacar the rightful King built an army in exile, and returned to oust Castamir and reclaim his throne.


* Cats|Cat

* Celduin
River flowing from the Lonely Mountain to the Sea of Rh?. Translated 'River Running'.
-----
The Elvish name for the river known by Men as the River Running. It rose at the gates of Erebor, and flowed long miles southward and eastward to its outflow into the Sea of Rh?.


* Celebdil
Called the Silvertine, one of the three peaks in the Misty Mountains (with Caradhras and Fanuidhol) that lay above the ancient Dwarf-city of Khazad-d?.

-----
Leader of the People of the Jewel-smiths.
 The son of Curufin and grandson of F?nor, who led the Elves of Eregion during the Second Age and played a great part in the making of the Rings of Power.


* Celebrindal
The surname of Idril of Gondolin.
 The surname, meaning 'silver-foot', of Turgon's daughter Idril, who became the mother of E?endil the Mariner. She gained the name, apparently, because she walked barefoot wherever she went.


* Celebrindor
The fifth King of Arthedain.
 Celebrindor the son of Celepharn ruled Arthedain during a time of relative calm. He was the last King to enjoy a peaceful reign, and the last not to know the name of Angmar. Soon after his death, evil things began to stir again, and the Lord of the Nazg? came into the north as the Witch-king, to found the realm that would eventually destroy Celebrindor's kingdom.
 Celebrindor ruled Arthedain for eighty-one years, and was succeeded by his son Malvegil.


* Celebros
'Silver Foam' or 'Silver Rain', a stream in Brethil falling down to Teiglin near the Crossings.
-----
The stream of the Rainy Stair.
 A minor tributary of the River Teiglin that flowed beneath the eaves of the Forest of Brethil. The Celebros descended southwards from the highlands of Brethil into the Ravines of Teiglin through a series of waterfalls that filled the air with fine spray (the name Celebros means 'silver spray'). A wooden bridge crossed the Celebros at a place called - because of the waterfalls' spray - Dimrost, or the Rainy Stair.
 Dimrost's name was changed when Nienor came to cross the Celebros. When she reached the bridge, which gave a wide view of the Ravines of Teiglin to the south and west, a foresight of her doom seems to have come upon her (she was to die in the waters of the Teiglin). The sudden shuddering that overtook her then gave a new name to the crossing of the Celebros: Nen Girith, the Shuddering Water.


* Celegorm
The third son of F?nor, called the Fair; until the Dagor Bragollach lord of the region of Himlad with Curufin his brother; dwelt in Nargothrond and imprisoned L?hien; master of Huan the wolfhound; slain by Dior in Menegroth.
-----
Celegorm the Fair was the third of the seven sons of F?nor. The most ambitious of the seven, he followed the oath of his father with the greatest ardour, and this led him to his destruction.
 In Valinor, Celegorm became a great hunter, and had the friendship of Orom? often hunting with the Vala or visiting his house. From Orom? Celegorm gained great knowledge of birds and beasts, and he learned to understand their tongues, and he gained also another gift, Huan the great hound. He also had great friendship with his cousin Aredhel, the daughter of Fingolfin.
 After the Darkening of Valinor, he stood in the court of Tirion with his father and his six brothers, and swore to the Oath of F?nor. With that, he marched with the Noldor from Valinor and returned to Middle-earth as the Moon rose for the first time. The faithful hound Huan accompanied Celegorm into exile.
-----
Early Years in Beleriand, I 1 - I 455: In the first assault of the Noldor on the Orcs, the Dagor-nuin-Giliath, Celegorm found himself in the hills around Eithel Sirion, in the north of the Ered Wethrin. Receiving news of an orc-host coming north from the Falas, he ambushed them and drove them into the Fen of Serech.
 After the battle, in which his father F?nor died, he journeyed to the land of Himlad in the eastern regions of Beleriand, and there took up his abode with his younger brother Curufin. Celegorm and Curufin together claimed the land between the rivers Aros and Celon, and they fortified the Pass of Aglon in the north against the forces of Morgoth. During this time, the two were close in friendship with their brother Caranthir, who dwelt across the valley of the river Gelion in the land of Thargelion, and often went hunting with him.
 The land of Himlad was held for more than 450 years by Celegorm and his brother, but in the Dagor Bragollach, Morgoth's armies broke the defence of the Pass of Aglon, and overran Celegorm's lands. With his brother Curufin, he was forced to flee, and they journeyed south and west until they came to Finrod's halls in Nargothrond.
-----
Time in Nargothrond, I 455 - c. I 465: Finrod received his cousins warmly, and for a time Celegorm and Curufin dwelt happily in Nargothrond, hunting the Orcs and wolves that dared to cross the Guarded Plain. They were at that time mighty lords, and their power and influence in Finrod's domain grew.
 Before many years had passed, though, Beren came out of Doriath seeking Finrod's help in his quest for the Silmaril. The Oath of F?nor bound Celegorm to defy any that sought a Silmaril, but Finrod was also bound by an oath, to Beren's father Barahir, to lend aid in the quest, and so he departed from Nargothrond, leaving it in the keeping of his brother Orodreth. Celegorm and Curufin exercised their influence after the departure of Finrod, however, and during this time they were effectively the rulers of Nargothrond.
 While out hunting on the Guarded Plain, they discovered L?hien, who having escaped from her father in Doriath was seeking for Beren. Celegorm saw that to be wedded to the daughter of one of the greatest kings in Beleriand would be a great source of power, and so he tricked L?hien into returning to Nargothrond with him. Once there, he imprisoned her and sent false messages to Thingol, pursuing his suit.
 From L?hien, they learned that Beren and Finrod had been captured by Sauron and imprisoned in his fortress at Tol-in-Gaurhoth. They made no attempt to rescue them, believing that the death of Finrod would further their own power in Nargothrond. Celegorm's hound, Huan, disobeyed his master, and help L?hien to escape from the brothers, leading here away into the north after Beren.
 Though he later returned to Celegorm, their trust was diminished. While he was away from Nargothrond, Huan had aided in the defeat of Sauron in the north, and the destruction of Tol-in-Gaurhoth. Many prisoners of Sauron, who were released when his tower was destroyed, returned to Nargothrond and reported the fate of Finrod. So the lies that Celegorm and Curufin had told in pursuance of power were exposed, and the people turned back to their rightful king, Orodreth. Celegorm and Curufin were exiled from Nargothrond, but their deeds were repudiated by their people, who had come with them from Himlad, and so they journeyed friendless in Beleriand.
-----
Return to the Northern Lands, c. I 465 - c. I 500: After their expulsion from Nargothrond, the brothers journeyed to the north and east, seeking again the lands where they had once ruled, and especially Himring, where their elder brother Maedhros was still lord.
 As they travelled beside the eaves of Brethil, they discovered Beren and L?hien returning from the north, and attacked them. In defence of L?hien, Huan the hound deserted Celegorm and fought against him. Curufin lost his horse in that fight, and the brothers were forced to ride away eastwards together on Celegorm's steed. Journeying on through Dimbar and Nan Dungortheb, they came at last to the lands of Maedhros.
 Celegorm was not to abide there long, for only a few years after their arrival, Maedhros united the Elves of Beleriand, and the great battle known as the Nirnaeth Arnoediad took place. Celegorm marched into the north with his brothers, and was wounded in the battle, but Uldor the Accursed betrayed the Elves and turned against them, and so the host of Maedhros was broken and scattered. Celegorm fled with his brothers to the lands below Mount Dolmed, in the far east of Beleriand.
 There they dwelt, a broken and wandering people, for some thirty years. In that time, Beren and L?hien dwelt in the far south, on the island of Tol Galen in the River Adurant, and with them was the Silmaril that they had recovered from Morgoth's crown. While their oath bound the brothers to recover the jewel, none dared assail that hallowed island, and so they waited.
 Eventually, Beren and L?hien passed away, and the Silmaril was taken to Dior, Thingol's heir, in Doriath. Now the sons of F?nor sent demands to Dior for the return of the jewel, but Dior disregarded them. So the brothers formed an army and assaulted the halls of Menegroth, and there Celegorm was slain by Dior, though Dior also perished, as did Curufin and Caranthir.


* Celepharn
The fourth King of Arthedain.
 The son of Mallor and great-grandson of Amlaith of Fornost, the founder of Arthedain. He ruled Arthedain early in the second millennium of the Third Age, at a time when the South-kingdom of Gondor was at the height of its power (the great Atanatar Alcarin became King of Gondor during Celepharn's rule in the north).
 The first Hobbits had been seen in Eriador in the reign of Celepharn's grandfather Beleg, and Celepharn might even have encountered them himself as a young man. During his own reign, though, their numbers increased as the growing darkness in Mirkwood drove them westward out of Rhovanion. Fallohides and Stoors crossed the Misty Mountains at this time, joining the Harfoots who had been living in the west for a century or more.
 Celepharn ruled Arthedain for eighty-one years, and was succeeded by his son Celebrindor.


* Celon
River flowing southwest from the Hill of Himring, a tributary of Aros. The name means 'stream flowing down from heights'.
-----
A tributary of the Aros that rose in the highlands around Himring and flowed southwestwards until it met the Aros on the borders of Doriath. The woods of Nan Elmoth lay on its southern bank.


* Celos
One of the rivers of Lebennin in Gondor; tributary of the Sirith.


* Cemendur
Meneldil's son and heir.
 Cemendur was descended from a mighty line of lords: his great-grandfather was Elendil himself, and he was the grandson of An?ion and son of Meneldil. Nonetheless, of his reign as King of Gondor we know almost nothing. It seems that Gondor had peace during his reign, since the only recorded historical event to take place during it was the birth of Elrond's daughter Arwen in the north, three years after Cemendur took the throne. No-one in Gondor at that time, of course, could have known how significant that event would be: nearly three thousand years later, Arwen was to wed Aragorn, a distant descendant of Cemendur's great-grandfather Elendil, and become Queen of Cemendur's realm.
 Cemendur ruled in Gondor for eighty-six years, and was succeeded by his son E?endil.


* Ceorl
Rider of Rohan who brought news of the Second Battle of the Fords of Isen.


* Cerin Amroth
The mound of Amroth, that stood in the heart of L?ien and held the house of that King before he was lost. It was here that Aragorn and Arwen plighted their troth centuries later.


* Cermi?Cermie
The seventh month of the year, according to the Stewards' Reckoning of Gondor, following Lo?d? and preceding Urim? On a modern calendar, Cermi?ran between 23 June and 22 July, in a normal year.


* Chamber of Mazarbul|Mazarbul
The old Chamber of Records of Khazad-d?. It was used as a base by Balin when he attempted his ill-fated attempt at recolonisation: the Company of the Ring found his tomb there as they passed through Moria.


* Chamber of Records
The Chamber of Mazarbul in Khazad-d?.
 The Chamber of Mazarbul in old Khazad-d?, its hall of records; a large, square chamber lit by a single shaft of light from the open air. When Balin led an attempt to recolonise Moria, he chose this place as his seat, but it became his tomb.


* Chetwood
The wood of the Bree-land.
 The broad woodland that lay to the north and east of the Bree-hill. The village of Archet was built among the trees near its edge.

* Chieftain of the D?edain|Chieftain
The title taken by the Heirs of Isildur after the loss of the kingdom of Arthedain; sixteen lords of Men, from Aranarth (elder son of Arvedui, last King of Arthedain) to Aragorn II Elessar.
-----
1- Aranarth (Chieftain for 131 years to III 2106): The heir of Arvedui, who would have become King of Arthedain if not for the destruction of his realm by the Witch-king. He saw his loss avenged, though, when a great army of D?edain out of Gondor, led by E?nur, wiped out the Witch-king's own realm of Angmar. During his time, the Watchful Peace began, and the Heirs of Isildur had peace until the time of Arahad I.
2- Arahael (Chieftain for 71 years to III 2177).
3- Aranuir (Chieftain for 70 years to III 2247).
4- Aravir (Chieftain for 72 years to III 2319).
5- Aragorn I (Chieftain for 8 years to III 2327): The first Aragorn, after whom Aragorn of the War of the Ring was named, lost his life in eastern Eriador, where he was slain by wolves.
6- Araglas (Chieftain for 128 years to III 2455).
7- Arahad I (Chieftain for 68 years to III 2523): In his time, the evil that had once dwelt in Dol Guldur returned, and the Watchful Peace came to an end. In the eighth year of his reign, the White Council was formed, a matter that Arahad must surely have been aware of, if he was not directly involved himself. As the years drew on, the extent of the danger from the east became more evident; the Misty Mountains were filled with Orcs, and near the end of Arahad's time as Chieftain, Celebr?n the wife of Elrond was captured and tortured by them.
8- Aragost (Chieftain for 65 years to III 2588).
9- Aravorn (Chieftain for 66 years to III 2654).
10- Arahad II (Chieftain for 65 years to III 2719).
11- Arassuil (Chieftain for 65 years to III 2784): Arassuil saw Eriador openly invaded by Orcs out of the Misty Mountains, who penetrated as far west as the Shire. The period between III 2745 and III 2748 is recorded as being the time of worst warfare, and it was in this time that the Battle of Greenfields was fought in the Northfarthing. Arassuil was Chieftain at the time of the Long Winter.
12- Arathorn I (Chieftain for 64 years to III 2848): It is known that Arathorn met an untimely end, though no records remain of his fate. Perhaps he was slain by Orcs or wolves, though the worst of the fighting with the Orcs of the Mountains had been over for a century before his death.
13- Argonui (Chieftain for 64 years to III 2912): The last winter of Argonui's rule was the so-called Fell Winter, in which the northern lands were troubled by White Wolves out of the north, and the floods from the snow-melts of the following spring spread destruction far and wide.
14- Arador (Chieftain for 18 years to III 2930): Arador enjoyed only a short time as Chieftain, during which he saw his son Arathorn wed Gilraen. Soon after, journeying in the fells north of Rivendell, he was captured by Hill-trolls and slain.
15- Arathorn II (Chieftain for 3 years to III 2933): Arathorn's time as leader of the Rangers was even shorter than his father's. After just three years as Chieftain, he went hunting Orcs with Elladan and Elrohir, and was shot by an arrow. He was succeeded by his son Aragorn, then just two years old.
16- Aragorn II (Chieftain for 86 years to III 3019): Most famous of all the Chieftains, Aragorn had great friendship with the Wizard Gandalf. He journeyed the length and breadth of Middle-earth, doing heroic deeds in the service of both Rohan and Gondor. He played a great part in the War of the Ring, and at its end as rightful Heir of Isildur took up the Kingship of his noble ancestor, reuniting the North- and South- kingdoms after more than three thousand years.

-----
The two Speaking Peoples fated in the Music of the Ainur; Elves and Men.


* Children of the Sun
A name given by Elves to Men, who awoke at the first rising of the Sun, and hence feared the night.


* Chubb Family|Chubb
An important hobbit-family of the Shire.
 A family of Shire-hobbits, of whom several were present at Bilbo Baggin's Birthday Party. Their main connection with the Baggins family was through Bilbo's grandfather, the Old Took, whose wife Adamanta Chubb was mother to no fewer than twelve children, including Bilbo's mother Belladonna.


* Chubb-Baggins Family|Chubb-Baggins
A branch of the Baggins of Hobbiton.
 A family created by the wedding of Bilbo's uncle Bingo Baggins to Chica Chubb. It seems to have lasted just three generations; what evidence we have suggests that the last Chubb-Baggins was Bingo's grand-daughter Poppy, who married into the Bolger family.


* Circle of Isengard
The great circular wall surrounding the inner plain of Isengard, in the centre of which ws Orthanc. Also called Ring of Isengard.


* C?dan|Cirdan
'The Shipwright'; Telerin Elf, lord of the Falas (coasts of West Beleriand); at the destruction of the Havens after the Nirnaeth Arnoediad escaped with Gil-galad to the Isle of Balar; during the Second and Third Ages keeper of the Grey Havens in the Gulf of Lh?; at the coming of Mithrandir entrusted to him Narya, the Ring of Fire.
-----
The keeper of the Grey Havens.
 A lord of the Teleri in Middle-earth, C?dan was persuaded to remain in Beleriand with some of his people by Oss?when the other Teleri were taken into the West by Ulmo. Lord of the Falas during much of the First Age, he removed to the Isle of Balar after the Nirnaeth Arnoediad. At the end of the First Age, with the destruction of Beleriand, he moved eastwards and founded Mithlond, the Grey Havens, on the Gulf of Lh?.
 He remained in Lindon throughout the Second and Third Ages. Throughout the Second Age, that land was under the direct rule of High King Gil-galad. At the time of the fall of Eregion, Celebrimbor sent two of the Three Rings north to the High King, and Gil-galad in turn passed one of these to C?dan; Narya, the Ring of Fire. At the end of the Second Age, Gil-galad fell in the War of the Last Alliance, leaving Lindon without a ruler. His natural heir would have been Elrond, who had long since removed to Imladris, and so C?dan took on the leadership of the Elves west of the Blue Mountains.
 C?dan continued to maintain the havens at Mithlond throughout the Third Age and into the Fourth. When the Wizards arrived in Middle-earth, he perceived that Gandalf was the wisest of them, and gave him the Red Ring to bear in secret. He took an active part in the events of the Third Age, too; it was his mariners, for example, who sought to rescue Arvedui the last King of Arthedain. He was still the master of the Grey Havens at the end of the Age, when he saw the Ring-bearers' White Ship, that he had held in preparation over the long years, pass into the West.


* Ciril|Kiril
A minor river of western Lamedon.
 A short tributary to the River Ringl? The Ciril rose in the White Mountains of western Lamedon, about twenty miles east of Tarlang's Neck. It flowed directly southwards, through its fords at Calembel, to meet the Ringl?
 'Ciril' is the later spelling of this river's name, used throughout the text of The Lord of the Rings. The large-scale contour map given at the beginning of Book V, though, shows the older form of the name, 'Kiril', which reflects its correct pronunciation.


* Cirion
Twelfth Ruling Steward of Gondor, who granted Calenardhon to the Rohirrim after the battle of the Field of Celebrant in Third Age 2510.
-----
The Steward that gifted Calenardhon to Eorl.
 The twelfth Ruling Steward of Gondor, the son of Steward Boromir. He called on the Northmen for aid in the wars of Gondor, and rewarded them with the land of Calenardhon (later called Rohan) when they answered his call.


* Cirith D?th|Cirith Duath
'Shadow Cleft', former name of Cirith Ungol.

* Cirith Gorgor
Called the Haunted Pass, the point were the mountain ranges of the Ered Lithui and the Ephel D?th met, to the northwest of Mordor. It was sealed by the Black Gate of the Morannon, and guarded by the Towers of the Teeth.


* Cirith Ninniach
'Rainbow Cleft', name given by Tuor to the ravine leading from the western hills of Dor-l?in to the Firth of Drengist, and by which he came to the Western Sea; see Annon-in-Gelydh.
-----
The rocky pass through the northwestern mountains of Middle-earth that led to the Great Sea at the Firth of Drengist. It was into this cleft that the Gate of the Noldor led, and Tuor escaped this way on his fateful mission to Gondolin.


* Cirith Thoronath
'Eagles' Cleft', a high pass in the mountains north of Gondolin, where Glorfindel fought with a Balrog and fell into the abyss.


* Cirith Ungol
'Spiders Cleft'; pass over the Ephel D?th above Minas Morgul. See Cirith D?th.
-----

* Cirth
The Runes, first devised by Daeron of Doriath.
-----
The Elvish word for Runes, characters designed to be cut into a surface, rather than written with a brush or pen.


* Ciryaher
Victor over the southern lands.
 Ciryaher, the son of King Ciryandil, was to become the last of Gondor's four Ship-kings. The haven of Umbar had been captured by his grandfather E?nil, but Gondor had been hard put to defend the haven since its capture. Ciryaher's father was himself lost in an assault by the Haradrim, holding the defence of Umbar. Ciryaher was a patient man, and slowly built his fleets and his armies in the north until he was sure of victory. At last, thirty-five years after his father's loss, he launched an unstoppable assault on the southern lands, and utterly conquered the Men of Harad. From this time, Ciryaher took the name Hyarmendacil, signifying 'South-victor'.
 Ciryaher ruled in Gondor for one hundred and thirty-four years, and brought that land to the height of its glory. He was succeeded by his son Atanatar II Alcarin.


* Ciryandil
Third of the four Ship-kings of Gondor.
 E?nil I was the second of the Ship-kings of Gondor, famous for capturing the southern haven of Umbar. When he was lost at sea, he was succeeded by his son Ciryandil, who continued his father's naval policies. Ciryandil reigned over Gondor for seventy-nine years, and died in the defence of Umbar against the Haradrim. He was succeeded by his son Ciryaher, who went on to avenge his father and conquer the southern lands, and so ruled in the name of Hyarmendacil I.


* Ciryatur
N?en?ean admiral commanding the fleet sent by Tar-Minastir to the aid of Gil-galad against Sauron.


* Ciryon
Third son of Isildur, slain with his father and his brothers Elendur and Aratan in the Disaster of the Gladden Fields.


* Citadel of Gondor
A term sometimes used loosely of Minas Tirith in Gondor, but in fact strictly referring to the fortified seventh and highest circle of that city.


* City of Gondor
Minas Tirith beneath Mindolluin.
 A name given, at least at the time of the War of the Ring, to Minas Tirith, Gondor's great fortified city that stood at the eastern extent of the White Mountains. In fact, at the time of the country's founding, Gondor's chief city had been Osgiliath, some miles east and north of Minas Tirith, but this ancient city did not survive through the Third Age. King Tarondor abandoned Osgiliath for Minas Anor in III 1640, and from that time on Minas Anor, later renamed Minas Tirith, was truly the City of Gondor.


* Closed Door
Fen Hollen, the door in the sixth circle of Minas Tirith that led to the Silent Street and the tombs of the Kings of Gondor.


* Cloudyhead
The mountain named Fanuidhol.
 One of the three Mountains of Moria, named Fanuidhol by the Elves and Bundushath? (or just Shath?) by the Dwarves, many of whom had lived beneath it in the city of Khazad-d?.

* Cold-drakes|Cold-drake
The least mighty of Dragons.
-----
"Now the least mighty [dragons] - yet they were very great beside the Men of those days - are cold as in the nature of snakes and serpents, and of them a many having wings go with the uttermost noise and speed..."
(Turambar and the Foal?? in The History of Middle-earth vol. II, The Book of Lost Tales II)
-----
Lesser dragons; those of dragon-kind who did not have the ability to make fire.
 They were used by Morgoth in the wars of the First Age, though no specific mention of them in this period remains in Tolkien's published work. After the War of Wrath, in which most would have perished, some few seem to have escaped into the northern regions of Middle-earth, beyond the Grey Mountains.
 As the millennia passed, their numbers grew, until they became a serious threat in the later centuries of the Third Age to the Dwarves that mined the Grey Mountains. In the year 2589 of the Third Age, D?n I, King of Durin's Folk, and his second son Fr? were slain at the gates of their halls by a Cold-drake. The attacks of these fearsome creatures persuaded to Dwarves to migrate eastwards from the Grey Mountains, and it was soon afterwards that their realms in the Iron Hills and at Erebor were established.
 Of the history of the Cold-drakes after this period we are given no hint. Four hundred years later, at the time of Bilbo Baggins' journey to Erebor, they seem to have left the Grey Mountains (at least, Gandalf makes no mention of them when describing the dangers of that region). It is possible that the Orcs who colonised the Mountains after the departure of the Dwarves drove them back into the cold wastes to the north, but we can do no more than speculate on their ultimate fate.


* Combe
A village of the Bree-land.
 A village that lay in a deep valley on the eastern side of the Bree-hill, between Archet to the north and Staddle to the south. The village took its name from its location: combe is an old word for a valley, and the same element appears in 'Deeping-coomb', a valley in the White Mountains far to the south of the Bree-land.


* Common Speech
The Westron, the language that evolved from Ad?aic as spoken in N?enor, as the common tongue of the peoples of Middle-earth.


* Common Tongue
The Common Speech of the Westlands.
 The Common Language used throughout the northern and western lands of Middle-earth. It developed from the N?en?ean tongue, Ad?aic, but with many additions and changes from other languages, to become almost universally spoken.


* Company of the Ring
The nine companions who set out from Rivendell on the Quest of Mount Doom. They were: Aragorn, Boromir, Frodo Baggins, Gandalf, Gimli Elf-friend, Legolas Greenleaf, Meriadoc Brandybuck, Peregrin Took, Samwise Gamgee.


* Coranar
An Elvish word for 'year'.
 Literally 'sun-round', a name given by the Elves to a single year.


* Cordial of Imladris
A name for miruvor.
 The reviving cordial made by the Elves of Imladris and called by them miruvor. A flask of the precious drink was given to Gandalf for the refreshment of the Company of the Ring during the southward journey, but seems to have been lost in his fall from the Bridge of Khazad-d?.


* Cormallen
A garth of Ithilien.
 A tree-lined field in North Ithilien, on the banks of the Anduin near to Cair Andros. It was here that Frodo and Sam were received after they achieved the Quest of Mount Doom, and praised with great praise.

* Corollair?Corolla??Corollaire
The 'Green Mound' of the Two Trees in Valinor; also called Ezellohar and Coron Oiolair?
-----
The mound of the Two Trees.
 A name for the Green Mound that stood outside the gates of Valmar, on which the Two Trees of Valinor grew. The name corollair?means literally means 'summer mound'.


* Corsairs of Umbar|Corsairs|Corsair
Pirates from the lands south of Gondor.
 The people of Umbar during the later Third Age, largely descended from Castamir the Usurper and his followers, who, though they were Gondorian in origin, continued a long enmity against the land of their ancestors.


* Cotman
The grandfather of Farmer Cotton.
 The son of Cottar, and an ancestor of the Cottons of Bywater. Cotman was apparently not a wealthy Hobbit - his name means 'cottage dweller', meaning that he lived in a particularly small hobbit-hole. He married Rose, the daughter of Holman the greenhanded, and their son (also called Holman) was the first Hobbit to use the family-name of Cotton.


* Cottar
The ancestor of the Cotton family.
 The oldest known member of the Cotton family, though in fact the name 'Cotton' would not appear until the time of his grandson Holman Cotton. Cottar was born in the year 1220 by the Shire-reckoning, that is some two centuries before the War of the Ring. He had two sons, Cotman and Carl. Cotman married Rose, the daughter of Holman the greenhanded, and so began a long association between Cottar's descendants and Holman's.


* Cotton Family|Cotton
The descendants of Cottar.
 Cottar, the founder of the Cotton clan, was born some two hundred years before the War of the Ring. It was his grandson, Holman, who was the first to take the surname Cotton. 'Long Horn', as Holman was known, is also the first of the Cottons to be explicitly connected with the village of Bywater, which remained the seat of the family from that time on. Indeed, the name 'Cotton' means 'cottage town', and may actually be a reference to Bywater village.
 Holman's son Tolman farmed the lands to the south of Bywater, and it was he who made the family one of the most important in the Shire. He played a significant part in the decisive Battle of Bywater, the most important step in the recovery of the Shire from Sharkey's Men, and his daughter Rose married Sam Gamgee in the following spring.


* Council of Elrond
The council held at Rivendell before the departure of the Fellowship of the Ring.
-----
The war-council of the Wise.
 The council held on 25 October III 3018 at Rivendell, where the history of the Ring was discussed, and its fate debated. Present at the council were representatives of all the free peoples of Middle-earth.
 The Council of Elrond: Aragorn, Bilbo Baggins, Boromir, Elrond Half-elven, Erestor and other counsellors of Elrond, Frodo Baggins, Galdor of the Havens, Gandalf, Gimli, Gl?n, Glorfindel, Legolas.
 After much debate, four main proposals were put forward. Erestor, Elrond's chief counsellor, suggested taking the Ring back westward to Tom Bombadil, in the hope that he could withhold it from Sauron. Glorfindel suggested something similar: carrying the Ring west to the Great Sea and casting it in. Both of these courses were thought too dangerous to attempt, and rejected for other reasons besides.
 Boromir of Gondor had a bolder proposal: to take the Ring and wield it against its maker. The dangers of doing this were all too clear, and none of those present who might have taken up the Ring would agree to do so.
 The final conclusion of the Council was to follow the course devised by Elrond himself, to carry the Ring into Mordor and cast it into Mount Doom. By no means all the Council agreed with this course. Erestor in particular saw little hope of succeeding. 'That is the path of despair,' he said, 'Of folly I would say, if the long wisdom of Elrond did not forbid me.' (The Fellowship of the Ring II 2, The Council of Elrond).
 Nonetheless, Elrond's plan was accepted as the only course possible. As Gandalf said, 'It is wisdom to recognise necessity, when all other courses have been weighed...' (ibid). Frodo the Ring-bearer took on the task, and a Company for him was assembled from five others of those present at the council, to which were added the Hobbits Samwise Gamgee, Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took. This was the Company or Fellowship of the Ring, that set out for Rivendell on the journey that Erestor had called the 'path of despair'.


* Council of Gondor
Advisors to the ruler of the South-kingdom.
 In his account of Arvedui's claim on Gondor's throne, Tolkien once mentions a body known as the Council of Gondor, who act as the legal authority of Gondor after the loss of Ondoher left it kingless. Except for the fact that it acted under the control of Steward Pelendur, we are told almost nothing of this Council or its normal function.
 It was traditional among the Men of N?enor for the King to maintain a council of advisers, and it is not unreasonable to presume that their descendants in Gondor followed a similar system. The N?en?ean 'Council of the Sceptre' was composed of nobles from each of the main regions of N?enor, together with the King's Heir. It is fair to assume, then, that Gondor's Council was made up from representatives of each of the South-kingdom's separate lands, probably in addition to the King's heir, and apparently the Steward as well.


* Council of the Sceptre
Advisors to the King of N?enor.
 The nobles and lords of N?enor, together with the King's Heir, who gathered to advise the King on weighty matters of state.


* Council of the Wise
Also called the White Council, the alliance of the great among the Elves and Wizards formed in the Third Age to organize and coordinate the defence against Sauron and his servants.

* Cracks of Doom
The heart of Orodruin.
 The Sammath Naur; the forge and workshop of Sauron tunnelled deep into Orodruin and open to its central fire.


* Crebain
Black crows out of the southern Misty Mountains.
 Large black birds of crow-kind, native to the lands that bordered the southern Misty Mountains, Dunland to the west and Fangorn to the east. They seemed to possess at least some level of intelligence, and were apparently used as spies by Saruman during the War of the Ring.


* Crickhollow
A village in the northern parts of Buckland; it was here that Frodo Baggins claimed to be his destination when he left Hobbiton.


* Crissaegrim
The mountain-peaks south of Gondolin, where were the eyries of Thorondor.
-----
The Abode of Eagles.
 The sheer-sided peaks to the south of the concealed city of Gondolin; in their heights were the eyries of Thorondor and his Eagles.
 From the peaks of the Crissaegrim, the Eagles guarded Gondolin from outsiders, and more than once they swept down from those inaccessible heights to play a part in the history of Middle-earth. It was from these mountains that Thorondor swooped to attack Morgoth himself after the Fall of Fingolfin, and to rescue Fingolfin's body from Morgoth's Wolves.


* Cross-roads
The road-meeting in central Ithilien.
 The point in the land of Ithilien were the road running northward from the Harad was crossed by the East-West Road from Osgiliath to Minas Ithil (later Minas Morgul). Although originally built and maintained by the Men of Gondor, the Cross-roads had effectively fallen under the control of Sauron at the time of the War of the Ring.


* Crossings of Poros|Crossing of Poros
The ford that led into South Gondor.
 The point on the River Poros where it was crossed by the Harad Road. The site of a battle in the late Third Age in which Steward T?in II of Gondor and King Folcwine of Rohan defeated a force of the Haradrim.

* Crown of Gondor
The jewelled helm of the Gondorian Kings.
 The tall jewelled and winged helm that served the Kings of Gondor as a Crown. After the loss of the last King, E?nur, it was held in the Houses of the Dead for nearly a thousand years, until a rightful heir came forward at the end of the Third Age.


* Crows|Crow
Black carrion birds associated in Tolkien's work with the forces of darkness. The most feared variety in the Westlands of Middle-earth was the large type known as crebain.


* Cuivi?en|Cuivienen
'Water of Awakening', the lake in Middle-earth where the first Elves awoke, and where they were found by Orom?
-----
Called the Water of Awakening, the land on the shores of the inland sea of Helcar where the first Elves awoke during the Years of the Trees; it lay far in the east of Middle-earth.


* Culumalda
Red-golden trees of the Field of Cormallen.
 A tree that grew in North Ithilien, and especially in the woods around the Field of Cormallen. It is almost unknown apart from a passing note by Christopher Tolkien, but its name suggests that it was tall and thin, and that its leaves were red-golden in colour.


* Cul?ien|Culurien
A name of Laurelin.


* Curufin
The fifth son of F?nor, called the Crafty; father of Celebrimbor.
-----
The fifth son of F?nor, closely associated with his elder brother Celegorm. He was slain in the assault by the Sons of F?nor on Menegroth, but survived by his son Celebrimbor, who became the greatest of the jewel-smiths of Eregion.

 The surname and title of Beleg was derived from Sindarin c?thalion, 'Strongbow', and indeed often appears in its English form as well as the original Elvish.


* Daeron

* Dagor Aglareb|Glorious Battle|Third Battle
The third great battle in the Wars of Beleriand, called 'the Glorious Battle'. In about the seventy-fifth year of the First Age, Morgoth sent his Orcs to ravage Beleriand; they poured through the Pass of Sirion and Maglor's Gap, but were beaten back and utterly destroyed by the armies of Fingolfin and Maedhros.


* Dagor Bragollach|Bragollach|Fourth Battle
'The Battle of Sudden Flame' (also simply the Bragollach), fourth of the great battles in the Wars of Beleriand, in which the Siege of Angband was ended.
-----
For more than four centuries, the forces of the Noldor had besieged Morgoth in his northern fortress of Angband, holding the northern mountain fences of Beleriand and their passes against his forces. In I 455 Morgoth broke the Siege of Angband in the battle that came to be known as the Dagor Bragollach, the Battle of Sudden Flame.
 The Battle began one night in winter, when Morgoth sent out rivers of flame from Angband that consumed the wide plains of Ard-galen. Then came his armies, numberless Balrogs and Orcs, led by Glaurung the dragon. They forced the highlands of Dorthonion, and took the fortresses of Angrod and Aegnor who dwelt there. Maglor's Gap was also taken, giving Morgoth an entry into Beleriand itself.
 Maedhros' fortress on Himring held against the tide of foes, and so did the tower of Minas Tirith in the west, and the mountain forts of Ered Wethrin. Nonetheless, the Siege was broken, the Sons of F?nor scattered, and the forces of Morgoth roamed now at will throughout the northern lands.
 As the battle raged against the Mountains of Shadow, Fingolfin the High King rode in anger across the dust of Anfauglith (the plain that had been Ard-galen) and challenged Morgoth to single combat. At the doors of Angband itself, they fought a great duel, but though Morgoth was wounded, Fingolfin was destroyed by the Hammer of the Underworld.


* Dagor Dagorath
The Last Battle.
 The prophesied final battle between the forces of light and darkess, called the Last Battle, in which Morgoth will return and suffer his final and ultimate defeat.

The starlit battle fought before the rising of the Moon, the second of the great battles in the Wars of Beleriand. Morgoth's forces attacked F?nor in Mithrim as he returned to Middle-earth from Aman, and yet the Noldor turned the attack and were victorious; F?nor, though, pressed on toward Angband, and was slain by Balrogs.


* Dagorlad
'Battle Plain', east of Emyn Muil and near the Dead Marshes (north of Mordor), site of the great battle between Sauron and the Last Alliance of Elves and Men at the end of the Second Age.
-----

* Dairuin
One of the twelve companions of Barahir on Dorthonion.


* Daisy Gamgee
Eldest daughter of Hamfast Gamgee and Bell Goodchild; a sister of Samwise Gamgee of the Company of the Ring.


* Daisy Gardner

* Damrod
A Ranger of Ithilien, the companion of Mablung and trusted guard of Faramir.


* Dark Elf
Title of E? of Nan Elmoth.
 When Melian set her Girdle around the land of Doriath, Thingol's kinsman E? left that land, and dwelt instead in the forest of Nan Elmoth. Living under the dark shadows of that ancient forest, and preferring the night to the day, he came to be widely known as the Dark Elf.
 E?'s epithet was no doubt influenced by the fact that the Sindarin Elves to whom he belonged were of the Moriquendi, the Dark Elves who had never seen the light of the Two Trees of Valinor.


* Dark Elves|Dark Elf
In the language of Aman all Elves that did not cross the Great Sea were Dark Elves (Moriquendi), and the term is sometimes used thus; when Caranthir called Thingol a Dark Elf it was intended opprobriously, and was especially so, since Thingol had been to Aman 'and was not accounted among the Moriquendi'. But in the period of the Exile of the Noldor it was often used of the Elves of Middle-earth other than the Noldor and the Sindar, and is then virtually equivalent to Avari. Different again is the title Dark Elf of the Sindarin Elf E?; but in the Quenta Silmarillion, Turgon no doubt meant that E? was of the Moriquendi.
-----
The Moriquendi, those Elves who refused the summons of the Valar to Valinor, or fell away on the Great Journey, and never saw the light of the Two Trees.
 The Dark Elves are often equated with the Avari, who refused the summons of the Valar and remained in the darkness of Middle-earth. This is not strictly correct; 'Dark Elves' also include those such as the Nandor and Sindar who started the Great Journey to Valinor, but never came there.


* Dark Land
Sauron's domain of Mordor.
 An occasional name used for Sauron's fortified country of Mordor. In fact 'Dark Land' is a possible interpretation of the name Mordor, though the alternative 'Black Land' is used much more frequently.
 On at least one early map of Arda, a great southern continent appears labelled 'Dark Land'. This region is not otherwise mentioned, and is unrelated to the Dark Land mentioned in The Lord of the Rings.


* Dark Lands
Term for Middle-earth in N?enor.


* Dark Lord
The term is used of Morgoth, and of Sauron.
-----
The title given to the two great Ainur who ruled the forces of darkness in Middle-earth, Morgoth and Sauron.
-----
The First Dark Lord - Morgoth: Morgoth descended into Arda at its beginning, and battled with the Valar for ages uncounted before the awakening of Elves and Men from his fortress at Utumno in the north of the world. The Valar defeated him and imprisoned him for three ages, but on his release he returned to Angband, north of Beleriand. During the First Age, the Noldor made hopeless war upon him for the return of the Silmarils, but at last the Valar came to their aid and overthrew Morgoth, banishing him forever from the World.
-----
The Second Dark Lord - Sauron: Sauron was the ancient lieutenant of Morgoth, and after the first Dark Lord's defeat, he took on his mantle and became a Dark Lord himself during the early Second Age. Taking the land of Mordor to dwell in, he corrupted the N?en?eans. Though he was defeated at the end of the Second Age, and his Dark Tower of Barad-d? was thrown down, he rose again during the Third Age, and was finally defeated with the destruction of the One Ring in III 3019.


* Dark Mountains
An old name for the Mountains of Mirkwood.
 The original name for the range of deeply forested hills that ran through the northern part of Greenwood the Great, whose name is a translation of the Elvish Emyn Duir. When the shadow of Dol Guldur fell on the forest, it was renamed 'Mirkwood', and this range of high hills came to be called the Mountains of Mirkwood.


* Dark Plague
The plague that robbed Gondor of its King.
 The dreadful plague that swept through Middle-earth in the middle years of the Third Age; its effects were worst in Gondor and the southern lands, but it affected even those who lived in the far north.


* Dark Power
A common epithet used, especially in Gondor, to describe Sauron.

* Dark Tower
A name for Sauron's fortress of Barad-d?, in the Black Land of Mordor.


* Dark Years
The years of the dominion of Sauron in the Second Age.
-----
A term for the long years of hardship of the Men of Middle-earth during the Second Age. While N?enor flourished, the Men of Middle-earth endured trouble and war, and many of them turned to the worship of Sauron in this time. The Dark Years ended with the coming of Elendil and his sons near the end of the Second Age.


* Darkening of Valinor

* Dead Men of Dunharrow
Men of Ered Nimrais who were cursed by Isildur for breaking their oath of allegiance to him.

-----
The short-lived discoverer of the One Ring.

* Deathless
Title given to Durin, eldest of the Fathers of the Dwarves. Though he lived to a very great age, Durin was not in fact deathless; he died some time during the First Age.


* Deep Elves|Deep Elf|Deep-elves|Deep-elf
A name for the Noldor.
-----
"Next came the Noldor, a name of wisdom, the people of Finw? They are the Deep Elves, the friends of Aul? and they are renowned in song..."
(Quenta Silmarillion 3, Of the Coming of the Elves and the Captivity of Melkor)
-----
A rarely-used name for the Noldor, the division of the Elves that Finw?led into Valinor.
 'Deep' is here used in the sense of 'profound' or 'wise'; the Noldor were considered the most learned and inventive of the Eldar; the great Vala Aul?taught them much during their time in Aman.


* Deephallow
A village on the Shire's eastern border, built on the banks of the River Brandywine. Immediately across the river was Haysend, the southernmost point of Buckland, while just to the south of Deephallow, the River Shirebourn flowed into the Brandywine.

(The Two Towers III 7, Helm's Deep)
-----
The solid stone wall, some twenty feet in height, that defended the refuges of the Rohirrim at Helm's Deep. It lay beneath the castle of the Hornburg, to which it was connected by a flight of steps.

-----
The valley that led to Helm's Deep.
 The deep, well-defended valley in the northern White Mountains that held Helm's Deep and the castle of the Hornburg. The site of an important battle, the Battle of the Hornburg, during the War of the Ring.


* Deeping-road
Road running northwards from the Deeping-coomb to join the Great Road east of the Fords of Isen.


* Deeping-stream
Stream flowing out of Helm's Deep down into Westfold.
-----
The stream of Helm's Deep.
 The stream that rose in the gorge of the White Mountains known as Helm's Deep. It flowed through a culvert in the wall that guarded that refuge of the Rohirrim, and then around the feet of the rock where the Hornburg stood, before beginning its journey into the wide lands of Rohan.


* Deer
Graceful creatures found throughout Middle-earth. Deer were traditionally dedicated to the Vala Nessa, and were said to follow her as she travelled through the wild lands.

One of the later names of Dorthonion (Taur-nu-Fuin), meaning 'Horror of Night-shadow'.


* Demons
Monstrous servants of Morgoth.
 Dread creatures that ranked among the most powerful of Morgoth's servants. The most feared of demons were the Balrogs, Maiar seduced to Melkor's service in the beginning of the world, but it seems the Dark Lord also had other lesser demons at his command.

* Denethor I (Steward of Gondor)|Denethor
The Steward who saw the end of the Watchful Peace.
 Denethor I was the tenth Steward to rule Gondor, in whose time the realm suffered perhaps the most calamitous upheaval in its history. When Denethor succeeded his childless uncle Dior in III 2435, Gondor had known peace for many generations. Nearly four hundred years earlier, during the Stewardship of Denethor's noble ancestor Mardil, Gandalf had gone to Dol Guldur and forced Sauron to withdraw into the east of Middle-earth. Though it was known that the Nazg? still infested Minas Morgul, they offered no threat to the South-kingdom, and Denethor had every reason to hope that this time of Watchful Peace would continue in his time.
 He was wrong. III 2460, the twenty-fifth of Denethor's rule, would be last year to see Gondor fully at peace for nearly six centuries. In that year, Sauron gave up his exile and returned to his fortress of Dol Guldur in Mirkwood. Just a few years later, it was seen that the Nazg? had not been idle in the years of the Peace - they unleashed a force of hideous soldier-orcs on Gondor, of the kind that was then unknown, but would become known as the Uruk-hai. They ravaged Ithilien and took Osgiliath, but Denethor's heir Boromir fought them back and recovered Gondor's holdings east of the River, though he was dreadfully wounded. These were the first skirmishes in a conflict that would not truly end until the time of the War of the Ring.
 Denethor I ruled as Steward for forty-two years, and was succeeded by his son Boromir.


* Denethor II (Steward of Gondor)|Denethor
Twenty-sixth and last (but one) Ruling Steward of Gondor, the second of the name; Lord of Minas Tirith at the time of the War of the Ring; father of Boromir and Faramir.
-----
Lord of Minas Tirith.
 Born during the Stewardship of his grandfather Turgon, Denethor was a Gondorian noble who would see some of the most turbulent times in his country's long history, culminating in the War of the Ring itself. While still a youth of twenty-one, he saw Sauron re-emerge as the Dark Lord of Mordor, and start building his power on Gondor's eastern borders. Just a few short years later, Mount Doom burst into fire once again. In Gondor's time of need, a new hero arose, and for a time Steward Ecthelion II (who had recently succeeded his father Turgon) was served by the mysterious captain Thorongil (who was long afterwards discovered to be none other than Aragorn of the Northern D?edain).
 Nearly twenty years passed, and beneath the looming threat of Mordor, Denethor wedded Finduilas, the daughter of Adrahil of Dol Amroth. Together they had two sons, Boromir and Faramir. Soon after, Denethor's father Ecthelion died, and Denethor succeeded to become Steward Denethor II.
 Just four years after Denethor succeeded to the Stewardship, Finduilas died at a young age for one of her line. For the next thirty years, Denethor ruled as a grim and serious Steward, and it later became known that for at least some of this time, he had made use of a palant? to gain knowledge, through which the malice of Sauron had begun to sap his will. In the end, the death of his elder son Boromir, and the imagined loss of his younger son Faramir, sent him mad. He burned himself to death with his palant? in his hands.
 Denethor II ruled as Steward for thirty-five years, and was succeeded by his younger son Faramir.


* D?r|Deor
Seventh King of Rohan.
-----
A direct descendant of Eorl the Young, who inherited the Kingship of Rohan from his father Goldwine. D?r's great-great-grandfather, Aldor the Old, had hunted out the Dunlendings that had harried the eastern borders of Rohan, and his successors Fr?, Fr?wine and Goldwine had enjoyed peaceful reigns because of their ancestor's enterprises. In D?r's time, this peace came to an end.
 It was later discovered that the Dunlendings had secretly been moving back into the northwestern uplands of Rohan throughout the reigns of D?r's predecessors. By D?r's own time, a powerful Dunlendish force had been established, and D?r was forced to ride northward from Edoras, ultimately to defeat his enemies. The victory was a bitter one, though, for he discovered that the Dunlendings had also captured the Ring of Isengard, which D?r had no possible means of recapturing. So D?r's reign saw the beginning of a danger from the north that would reach a crisis nearly fifty years later, when the Dunlendings were to come close to destroying Rohan alogether.
 D?r's turbulent reign lasted nineteen years. He was succeeded as King by his son, Gram.


* D?rwine|Deorwine
A brave knight of Rohan.
 An important knight of the Rohirrim. He had the rank of chief of the King's knights (that is, the King's Riders, the personal bodyguard of the King of Rohan). He fell with six of his men at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields before the gates of Minas Tirith.


* Dernhelm
?wyn as a Rider of the Rohirrim.
 The alias taken by ?wyn when she broke the command of her uncle Th?den and rode the the Battle of the Pelennor.

The wife of Thain Peregrin Took I, and mother of Faramir Took I.


* Dimbar
The land between the rivers Sirion and Mindeb.
-----
The empty land beneath the Crissaegrim.
 An empty land in the north of Beleriand, lying between the Forests of Brethil in the west and Neldoreth in the east.


* Dimrill Dale
The valley of Nanduhirion.
 The name given in the Common Speech to the valley that lay to the east of Khazad-d?, called Nanduhirion by the Elves and Azanulbizar by the Dwarves.


* Dimrill Stair
The pass down into the Dimrill Dale.
 The name given to the southeastern part of the Redhorn Pass, leading down into Nanduhirion, the Dimrill Dale. It was named the Dimrill Stair because of the sequence of waterfalls that led down into the lake of Kheled-z?am.


* Dimrost
The falls of Celebros in the Forest of Brethil; translated as 'the Rainy Stair'. Afterwards called Nen Girith.


* Dior (Steward of Gondor)|Dior
The ninth Ruling Steward of Gondor.
 Dior's grandfather Hador was the last truly long-lived of the Stewards, and ruled Gondor for one hundred and seventeen years. This meant that his son Barahir, and his grandson Dior both came late to the Stewardship and ruled for only a brief time. Dior was the last Steward to enjoy an untroubled rule, as his heir Denethor would see the breaking of the Watchful Peace, and the beginning of centuries of warfare.
 Dior is remarkable as the only recorded Ruling Steward to leave no direct heir. In volume XII of The History of Middle-earth we're told that he had no children of his own, and was succeeded therefore by the son of his sister R?n. This seems to be borne out by the Appendices to The Lord of the Rings, which state that Gondor's Stewardship became '... hereditary as a kingship, from father to son or nearest kin.' (Appendix A iv The Stewards, our italics). This reference to 'nearest kin' seems intended to refer specifically to Dior.
 Dior ruled as Steward for twenty-three years, and seems to have been succeeded by his nephew Denethor I.


* Dior Eluch?|Dior
Called Aranel, and also Eluch? 'Thingol's Heir'; son of Beren and L?hien and father of Elwing, Elrond's mother; came to Doriath from Ossiriand after the death of Thingol, and received the Silmaril after the death of Beren and L?hien; slain in Menegroth by the sons of F?nor.
-----
Grandson of King Elu Thingol, and son of Beren and L?hien, he dwelt with them for a while in Tol Galen. After Thingol was slain by Dwarves in Menegroth, and his halls sacked by the host of Nogrod, Dior went to dwell there as King of Doriath, with his wife Nimloth. At the passing of Beren and L?hien, the Silmaril that L?hien had worn was brought to Dior in Menegroth. He was assailed by the Sons of F?nor, who claimed the jewel for themselves, and slain in the final Ruin of Doriath.


* D?havel|Dirhavel

* Doom of Mandos
The Doomsman's Prophecy of the North.
 The dreadful prophecy and curse uttered by Mandos to F?nor and the Noldor as they marched back to Middle-earth from Aman, against the will of the Valar. The prophecy foretold many things that later came to pass, especially the evil consequences of the Oath of F?nor for himself and his Sons. So powerful were Mandos' words that F?nor's half-brother Finarfin gave up the march, and led his people back to dwell in Valinor.


* Doomsman of the Valar

 Title given to Mandos, who is given the power to pronounce judgement in matters of fate.


* Doors of Durin
The West-gate of Moria.

The gateway would normally stand open during the years of friendship between Khazad-d? and Celebrimbor's people in Eregion, to the west. When they were closed they could be opened again by speaking a single word, 'mellon' - the Elvish for 'friend'.


* Dor Caranthir
'Land of Caranthir'; see Thargelion.
-----
The wide lands of Caranthir the Dark.
 The later name for the lands east of the river Gelion and north of the Ascar. Originally known simply as Thargelion, the land beyond Gelion, they were settled by F?nor's fourth son Caranthir and his people, after which this region became known as Dor Caranthir, 'Caranthir's land'.


* Dor Daedeloth
'Land of the Shadow of Horror', the land of Morgoth in the north.


* Dor D?en|Dor Dinen
'The Silent Land', where nothing dwelt, between the upper waters of Esgalduin and Aros.


* Dor Firn-i-Guinar
'Land of the Dead that Live', name of that region in Ossiriand where Beren and L?hien dwelt after their return.
-----
At the ending of the Quest of the Silmaril, Beren met his death at the jaws of the great wolf Carcharoth. So great was L?hien's love of him, though, that she surrendered her own immortality so that he might return to Middle-earth for a time.
 They returned out of the Halls of Waiting, and on the green island of Tol Galen in the southern lands of Ossiriand, they lived in a Land of the Dead that Live, or Dor Firn-i-Guinar in the Elventongue.
 No mortal Man saw Beren or L?hien ever again, but they had happy relations with the Green-elves of Ossiriand who lived around them. After the slaying of L?hien's father Thingol, Beren took a force of Green-elves north to avenge his death, and recover the stolen Silmaril.
 From that time, the Silmaril was kept in Dor Firn-i-Guinar and borne by L?hien, and that land was said to become 'like a vision of the land of the Valar'. Dior, the son of Beren and L?hien, then left Dor Firn-i-Guinar with his family, and went to take up the rule his lost grandfather's kingdom of Doriath.
 Both Beren and L?hien were mortal, and at last their lives came to an end, and with them their Land of the Dead that Live. A lord of the Green-elves took the Silmaril, and brought it to their heir, Dior, in Doriath, and Dor Firn-i-Guinar was no more.


* Dor-C?rthol|Dor-Cuarthol
'Land of Bow and Helm', name of the country defended by Beleg and T?in from their lair on Amon R?h.
-----
The Land of Bow and Helm.
 In Doriath, T?in Turambar and Beleg Strongbow were great friends and comrades in arms. Through a tragic mistake, T?in caused the death of one of King Thingol's courtiers, and fled the land where he had grown up. After many adventures in the wild, he joined himself to an outlaw band who eventually came to the occupy the hill known as Amon Rudh. This was the old home of a family of Petty-dwarves, M? and his sons, who gave his home over to the outlaws in ransom for his life.
 One day in the midst of winter, Beleg sought out his old friend T?in, and they formed an alliance to defend that region against the Orcs of Morgoth. T?in took a new name, Gorthol, from the dreadful helm of his ancestors that Beleg had brought to him. Together with T?in's outlaws, they commanded a land that stretched from the River Teiglin in the north to the edges of Doriath in the south and east. This land was given the name Dor-C?rthol, the Land of Bow and Helm; the name comes from Beleg's great bow and the Dragon-helm of Dor-l?in borne by T?in.
 The land of Dor-C?rthol was to survive for less than a year. Perceiving that 'Gorthol' was truly T?in the son of H?in, Morgoth sent his spies to watch the lands around Amon Rudh. M? the Petty-dwarf, whose mansions the Two Captains had occupied, struck a bargain with the captain of Morgoth's Orcs, and betrayed Beleg and T?in. The outlaws were routed, Beleg was left for dead, and T?in was captured and led away to the north. Though Beleg in fact survived, and later rescued T?in, this was the end of the short-lived land of Dor-C?rthol.

-----
Thingol's Hidden Kingdom.
 The mighty forest kingdom of Elu Thingol, greatest of the realms of the Sindar in Beleriand. The kingdom lay in two parts, separated by the River Esgalduin. The lesser, northwestern Forest of Neldoreth, and the greater, southern Forest of Region. These forests, and the small oakwood known as Nivrim on the western banks of the Sirion, were encompassed by the Girdle of Melian, which protected the land from its enemies.
 In the midst of Doriath, carved into the rock by the River Esgalduin, lay the Halls of Menegroth, the Thousand Caves, citadel of King Thingol and Melian his queen.

* Dragon-helm of Dor-l?in|Dragon-helm|Dragon of Dor-l?in
Heirloom of the House of Hador, worn by T?in; also called the Helm of Hador.
-----
A visored steel helm, embossed and embellished with gold, that bore as its crest the head of Glaurung the Dragon. It was made originally for Azagh? of Belegost, who gave it as a gift to Maedhros, who in turn passed it on to his cousin Fingon. When Fingon made Hador the Lord of Dor-l?in, he granted the Dragon-helm to the new lord, and indeed legend tells that only Hador and his son Galdor had the strength to bear the mighty helm.
 There was at least one other Man strong enough the bear the helm: Galdor's grandson T?in. He often wore the Dragon-helm to war, and took one of his many names from it: Gorthol, the Dread Helm. The last clear record of the Dragon-helm is at the Battle of Tumhalad, where T?in is known to have worn it. Beyond this, there is a suggestion that he may have taken it with him to Brethil, and perhaps even worn it at the slaying of Glaurung himself. After that point, the great heirloom of the House of Hador is lost to history.


* Dragon-spell
The will-sapping gaze of the dragon.
 The bewildering magical gaze of certain powerful dragons, notably Glaurung and Smaug.


* Dragons|Dragon
The Worms of Morgoth.
 Mighty reptilian creatures who ranked among the most feared of the servants of the Dark Lord. Of the origins of dragons, no tale tells; the first of them to be seen was Glaurung, Father of Dragons, who first issued from Angband in the middle of the First Age. After Glaurung came many others to strike fear into Elves and Men for the next three ages; among them were Ancalagon the first winged dragon, Scatha who dwelt in the cold northern wastes, and Smaug, last of the great dragons.
 Dragons have powers of intelligence and speech, and many are also able to cast the dragon-spell, a bewildering confusion that effects any who gaze into the eye of the creature.
 The dragons were not destroyed at the end of the Third Age; some are said to have survived to our own time, but the great worms and drakes of the Elder Days are no more.


* Dramborleg
The great axe of Tuor, preserved in N?enor.


* Draugluin

* Dread Helm
The meaning of T?in's alias Gorthol.
 The translation of Gorthol, a name used by T?in during the time he dwelt with Beleg Strongbow in the caverns of Amon Rudh. It comes from the Dragon-helm of Dor-l?in that he wore when he hunted Orcs with Beleg, and the fame of his helm, and the bow of Beleg, gave that region for a time the name Dor-C?rthol, the Land of Bow and Helm.
 Because of its fame, the mighty Helm of Hador was to be T?in's undoing. Through it, despite his alias, Morgoth was able to learn where T?in could be found. Through the treachery of M?, T?in was captured by Orcs, and carried off toward Angband.


* Drengist

-----

-----
The forest beneath the Eilenach Beacon.
 The forest that grew around the feet of the Eilenach beacon-hill in An?ien, so named for the remnant of the Dr?dain who lived there.


* Dr?th|Druath|Dr?Dru|Dr?n|Druin
The Dr?dain. (Singular Dr? plural also Dr?n; Sindarin forms derived from the native name Drughu). See R?, R?


* Dr?dain|Druedain
Sindarin name (from Dr?+ adan, plural edain) of the 'Wild Men' of Ered Nimrais (and of the Forest of Brethil in the First Age). Called Wild Men, Woses; and see P?el-men.
-----
Wild Men of the Woods.
 An ancient branch of the race of Men, active in the wars against Morgoth in the First Age, and granted a home with the Edain in N?enor during the Second Age. By the end of the Third Age, the Dr?dain had become a secretive and dwindling people: the 'woses' of the Dr?dan Forest may have been the last of their kind in Middle-earth.

* Durin I the Deathless|Durin
Lord of the Dwarves of Khazad-d? (Moria).
-----
Eldest of Dwarves.
 The eldest of the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves, the first of that race to be created by the Vala Aul? He was set to sleep under the mountains of Middle-earth until after the awakening of the Elves.
 When he woke, he journeyed in the wilds until he came upon the Mirrormere, the lake that the Dwarves call Kheled-z?am. Looking upon mysterious stars reflected in its surface, he took this as a sign, and there founded a great city tunnelled in the heart of the Misty Mountains. This was Khazad-d?, later called Moria.
 Durin lived to a great age even by the measure of the Dwarves, but though he was called the Deathless, he was not immortal. He died some time before the end of the First Age, but he founded the line of the Kings of Durin's Folk that extended down through the history of Middle-earth.


* Durin III|Durin

-----
A King of Khazad-d? during the Second Age.
 The King of Durin's Folk at the height of their friendship with the Elves of Eregion. According to legend, he was given a Ring of Power - the ring that would later be known as the Ring of Thr? - by Celebrimbor himself.


* Durin VI|Durin
Doomed King of Khazad-d?.
 A descendant of Durin the Deathless, Durin VI was the King of Durin's Folk when the Balrog was awoken in Khazad-d?. The Balrog's name, Durin's Bane, comes from this King, who was one of the first to be slain by it.


* Durin VII|Durin
The last descendant of Durin to bear his name.
 The last of the seven Durins appears once in Appendix A to The Lord of the Rings, as an undated descendant of Thorin III. As such, we know almost nothing of him apart from the bare fact of his existence.
 In volume 12 of The History of Middle-earth (The Peoples of Middle-earth), though, we have access to the proofs of Appendix A, and a little more of Durin's life is revealed. His birth, it seems, was prophesied at the Battle of Five Armies, and he was born several centuries later. He led Durin's Folk back to recolonise Khazad-d? during the Fourth Age, where they remained 'until the world grew old and the Dwarves failed and the days of Durin's race were ended.'1 The status of this story is unclear, though: it never appeared in The Lord of the Rings, and may have been rejected by Tolkien after its composition.


* Durin's Bane|Bane of Durin
The Balrog of Moria.
-----
"Moria! Moria! Wonder of the Northern world! Too deep we delved there, and woke the nameless fear."
(Words of Gl?n from The Lord of the Rings 2 II, The Council of Elrond)
-----
When the Valar came against Morgoth at the end of the First Age, most of his servants were destroyed, but some few fled into the World and hid themselves in dark places. One such was a Balrog, probably the last of its kind in Middle-earth, that escaped into the east from the ruin of Angband and buried itself in the roots of the Misty Mountains beneath Khazad-d?.
 For more than five millennia, the Balrog 'slept' in its deep hiding place (perhaps it was using this time to grow in power, or rebuild its physical form). It remained undisturbed as the Second Age passed, and long into the Third. At last, the mithril-miners of King Durin VI stumbled upon it and it awoke from its long sleep. Durin was slain by the creature and his son N?n I became King.
 It seems that, under N?n, the Dwarves attempted to make a stand against the Balrog, but it was a power too great for them to control. For a year, they attempted to hold their mansions against it, but at last N?n and many of his subjects were slain, and the survivors fled from their ancient halls. At this time too, many of the Silvan Elves of L?ien left their land and escaped into the south.
 For some five hundred years, Moria (as Khazad-d? became known) was deserted but for the Balrog. In around the year 2480, though, Sauron began to put his plans for war into effect, and as part of these, he sent Orcs and Trolls to infest the Misty Mountains and bar the passes from Eriador into Rhovanion. Some of these creatures came to Moria.
 We are not told whether Sauron was aware of the Balrog's existence until then - certainly the exiled Dwarves had not recognised what kind of creature Durin's Bane was. It is clear, though, that the Balrog acknowledged Sauron's authority - if only because it allowed his creatures to remain in Moria. In addition, the messenger of Sauron who came to D?n II Ironfoot offered to return Moria to the Dwarves, which would have been impossible if the Balrog was not under Sauron's power.
 Despite an ill-fated attempt to recolonise Moria by Balin in III 2989, Durin's Bane remained a dark and brooding menace in the ancient kingdom of the Dwarves, whose nature was hidden to the outside world.
 In January III 3019, the Company of the Ring travelled through Moria on the Quest of Mount Doom. In Gandalf, the Balrog finally encountered a being of the same order and power as itself. As the two Maiar faced each other on the Bridge of Khazad-d?, Gandalf broke the Bridge and the Balrog fell into the depths, but Gandalf too was drawn into the abyss.
 Both survived the fall, and Gandalf pursued the Balrog for eight days through the deepest caverns beneath Moria. At last they came to the Endless Stair, and climbed the steps that led to the peak of Zirakzigil. There Durin's Bane fought its last battle - for two days and nights, the Balrog battled with Gandalf, but at last it was cast from the peak, and broke the mountain-side as it plunged to its doom.


* Durin's Day
A Dwarvish festival of the new year.
 The first day of the Dwarves' year was calculated according to the last new moon of autumn (that is, the new moon that occurs within two weeks of 6 October, on a modern calendar). Not every Dwarves' new year was a Durin's Day, though: Thorin says 'We still call it Durin's Day when the last moon of Autumn and the sun are in the sky together' (ibid). Only a Dwarvish new year where this occurs is technically a Durin's Day.


* Durin's Folk
The clan of the Longbeards.
 The Dwarves descended from Durin the Deathless, eldest of the seven Fathers of the Dwarves. Almost all of the Dwarves that appear in Tolkien's works are of this Folk.


* Durin's Tower
The tower that stood on the peak of Celebdil above Khazad-d?, where Gandalf defeated Durin's Bane.


* Durthang
A castle of Mordor that stood in the northern Ephel D?th, on the slopes above the Isenmouthe.

* Dwarf-road #1|Dwarf-road
Translating Men-i-Naugrim, a name of the Old Forest Road.
-----
The long east-west road beneath the trees of Mirkwood.
 The old road that followed a straight path through the forest of Mirkwood. Its history is unclear, but it seems to have been built by the Dwarves as a route between their cities and colonies on either side of the forest.


* Dwarf-road #2|Dwarf-road
Road leading down into Beleriand from the cities of Nogrod and Belegost, and crossing Gelion at the ford of Sarn Athrad.
-----

 The road built by the Dwarves of the Blue Mountains as a trade route to the Elves of Beleriand. It ran westward along the River Ascar for many miles, and entered East Beleriand where it crossed the Gelion at the ford called Sarn Athrad.


* Dwarf-tongue
The secret language of the Dwarves.
 The language of the Dwarves, more commonly referred to as Dwarvish, or by the Dwarves' own name for the tongue, Khuzdul. The details of the language remained largely unknown to outsiders, because the Dwarves held knowledge of their tongue as one of their races' deepest secrets. The vocabulary and grammar of the language are an almost complete mystery, with a very few exceptions found in place-names, inscriptions, and in the famous Dwarvish war cry 'Baruk Khaz?! Khaz? aim?u!'


* Dwarrowdelf
'Delving of the Dwarves': translation of Khazad-d? (Hadhodrond).
-----
The Mannish name for Khazad-d?.
 'Dwarf-delving', the name in the Common Speech for the mansions of Khazad-d?. 'Dwarrowdelf' is an anglicisation - the 'real' Westron name was Phurunargian.


* Dwarves|Dwarf
The Children of Aul?
-----
"Baruk Khaz?! Khaz? aim?u!"
("Axes of the Dwarves! The Dwarves are upon you!" - The battle-cry of the Dwarves; from The Lord of the Rings Appendix F I, Of Other Races: Dwarves)
-----
Unlike Elves and Men, the Dwarves are not Children of Il?atar; they were created by Aul?the Smith, though Il?atar granted them life. Aul?made seven Fathers of the Dwarves, and these slept through many ages until after the Awakening of the Elves. Almost all the Dwarves that appear in Tolkien's works were descended from the eldest of the Seven Fathers, Durin the Deathless.
 Like Aul?their maker, the Dwarves delighted in smithcraft and stoneworking; they mined and worked metals throughout the mountains of Middle-earth. The Dwarves kept themselves apart from the other races; their language, Khuzdul, was a closely guarded secret, and they told their true names to none but themselves (all the Dwarf-names in Tolkien are in the tongues of Elves or Men, not true Dwarf names).
-----
Origins of the Dwarves: The first Dwarves were made long ages ago by Aul?the Smith. He had dimly perceived the coming Children of Il?atar, and desired to make Children of his own to teach his many skills and arts.
 Aul?s work was doomed, though, because he did not have the power to grant independent life to his creations - that power belonged to Il?atar alone. When the Dwarves were completed, though, the voice of Il?atar spoke to Aul?and agreed to grant them true life, and include them in His plan for Arda. Il?atar would not allow the Dwarves to awaken, though, until after the Firstborn (the Elves), and so Aul?set them to sleep far apart from one another, deep underground, until the time came for their awakening.
-----
The History of the Dwarves Before the First Age: Il?atar promised Aul?that he would awaken the Fathers of the Dwarves 'when the time comes'. We must assume that he did so shortly after the Awakening of the Elves at Cuivi?en (very approximately between 9,000 and 10,000 years before the beginning of the First Age).
 It seems that not long passed after their awakening before Durin the Deathless, eldest of the Fathers, founded Khazad-d? (later called Moria) in the Misty Mountains. Certainly it was well established as their chief citadel by the time the first Dwarves crossed the Blue Mountains into Beleriand. This event is dated only as 'during the second age of the Captivity of Melkor', which would place it (approximately) between 3,000 and 6,000 years before the beginning of the First Age.
 The Dwarves had no settlement in Beleriand itself, but they built two mighty citadels in the Blue Mountains; Gabilgathol to the north and Tumunzahar to the south. These fortress-cities are better known by the Elvish versions of their names; Belegost and Nogrod. The Dwarves also laid the long road that ran westwards out of the Blue Mountains and along the course of the River Ascar, crossing into East Beleriand at Sarn Athrad.
-----
The Dwarves in Beleriand: For the Elves dwelling Beleriand, the first appearance of the Dwarves in the Blue Mountains was a startling revelation - until that time, the Elves had thought themselves the only speaking peoples in the World.
 Throughout the long ages, the Elves and Dwarves developed a mutual respect which, if not quite friendship, was far from enmity. After their return to Middle-earth at the beginning of the First Age, the Noldor became closest in friendship with the Dwarves - both peoples revered Aul? and both had a love of craft and making that made them natural allies.
 Of all the Elves of Beleriand, though, it was not a Noldo but a Sindarin Elf who became most trusted and respected by the Dwarves. This was E?, the Dark Elf of Nan Elmoth, who travelled often to the Dwarf-cities in the Blue Mountains, and who took also his son Maeglin during his youth.
-----
The Nature of the Dwarves: Aul?made the Dwarves at a time when the World outside Aman still lay under the dominion of Melkor, and so he made them sturdy and hard to survive the dangers and hardships of that time.
 In nature, the typical Dwarf is stubborn and secretive. Though they make loyal and good friends, they are also a proud and stern race. They do not suffer grievance or insult, and their enmity is long-lasting. They are said, though, to be quick to learn new skills.
 Probably the best known aspect of the Dwarvish character, though, is their strong instinctive skills in the working of metal and stone, no doubt derived from Aul?their maker, the Vala whose province these things were. In ancient times, they were said to have preferred working with copper and iron, though in later days they wrought gold and silver, and the mithril they found in the Mines of Khazad-d?. Of all the materials they worked with, they most revered and praised gemstones.
-----
Dwarvish Mortality: Though they live much longer than Men (usually around 250 years), Dwarves are mortal creatures. What happens after their death, though, is a mystery. The Elves have said that the Dwarves return to the stone from which they were made, but the Dwarves have a different belief.
 According to Dwarvish tradition, they are gathered by Mahal (their name for Aul? in a part of the Halls of Mandos set aside for them. After the end of the World and the Last Battle, they say, they will aid Aul?in the rebuilding of Arda.


* Dwarves of Belegost
Khaz? of Gabilgathol.
 The race of Dwarves whose halls were at Belegost, the northernmost of the two great Dwarf-cities that stood in the Blue Mountains during the First Age. They had generally better relations with the Elves than their neighbours in Nogrod, and as well as being responsible for the building of Menegroth, they fought bravely beside Elves and Men during the Nirnaeth Arnoediad.


* Dwarves of Erebor
The people of the Kingdom under the Mountain.

A contemptuous title for the Lord of the Nazg?.
 A title of the Lord of the Nazg?, granted him in defiance by ?wyn in her guise as Dernhelm during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. Its meaning is not completely certain, but it seems to be derived from the Old English words gedwimer ('sorcery') and l? ('corpse').

-----
Galadriel's magical wood.
 The name among the Rohirrim for the Elvish land of L?ien, meaning literally 'magical wood'.

* E?endil|Earendil
Called 'Halfelven', 'the Blessed', 'the Bright', and 'the Mariner'; son of Tuor and Idril Turgon's daughter; escaped from the sack of Gondolin and wedded Elwing daughter of Dior at the Mouths of Sirion; sailed with her to Aman and pleaded for help against Morgoth; set to sail the skies in his ship Vingilot bearing the Silmaril that Beren and L?hien brought out of Angband. The name means 'Lover of the Sea'.
-----
The mariner who sailed the Great Sea at the end of the First Age. He long sought a way to Aman, to seek the aid of the Valar against Morgoth, but the way was hidden. After the Sons of F?nor attacked the Exiles of Gondolin seeking the Silmaril, Elwing his wife escaped and came to him at sea, through the power of Ulmo, in the shape of a white sea-bird bearing the Silmaril on her breast.
 Through the power of the jewel, it is said, E?endil was at last able to find a way to the Undying Lands, and there stood before the Valar and begged their aid in the wars against Morgoth. The Valar listened to his plea, and sent the great force that finally conquered the Dark Lord and freed Middle-earth.
 E?endil's father was a Man, and his mother an Elf, so he and his wife Elwing and their sons were given the choice of race to which they wished to belong. Elwing chose Elvenkind, and E?endil did so too for her sake. He now sails the high airs with the Silmaril upon his brow, shining as the morning and evening star.


* E?endil (King of Gondor)|E?endil|Earendil

He shared his name with E?endil the Mariner, the great hero who voyaged to Aman and saved Middle-earth from the darkness of Morgoth nearly four thousand years before King E?endil's time.
 Unfortunately, Gondor's fifth King did not have quite the impact on history as his heroic namesake - in fact, there is no annal of any event that occurred under E?endil's Kingship.
 E?endil ruled Gondor for eighty-six years, and was succeeded by his son, Anardil.

He was succeeded as Steward by his son Beren.

* Eldacar (King of Gondor)|Eldacar
The deposed and restored King of Gondor.
 The son of King Valacar of Gondor and Vidumavi. Vidumavi was the daughter of Vidugavia of the Northmen, the self-styled King of Rhovanion, and so Eldacar was of only half-Gondorian descent, a fact that led many to doubt Eldacar's right to rule. After his father's death, he sat on the throne for just five years when civil war broke out in Gondor. Ultimately, he was deposed by his Captain of Ships, Castamir, who took the throne himself.
 Eldacar escaped into the north, where he spent ten years raising an army before he returned to reclaim his throne. In a great and bloody battle at the Crossings of Erui, Castamir was defeated and the remnant of his forces fled into the south, to Umbar. Eldacar ruled for another forty-three years after this war, known as the Kin-strife. His eldest son Ornendil had died at Castamir's hands, and he was succeeded by his second son, Aldamir.

* Eldar
The Elves of the Three Kindreds (Vanyar, Noldor and Teleri).
 According to Elvish legend the name Eldar 'People of the Stars' was given to all the Elves by the Vala Orom? It came however to be used to refer only to the Elves of the Three Kindreds (Vanyar, Noldor, and Teleri) who set out on the great westward march from Cuivi?en (whether or not they remained in Middle-earth), and to exclude the Avari. The Elves of Aman, and all Elves who ever dwelt in Aman, were called the High Elves (Tareldar) and Elves of the Light (Calaquendi); see Dark Elves, Umanyar.
-----
The Elves of the Great Journey.
 The name given to the Elves by the Vala Orom?when he first found them wandering in the starlight of Cuivi?en. At first, the name was applied to all Elves, but after the summons of the Valar, it came to be used only of the peoples who followed the summons and began the Great Journey.
 The Three Kindreds of the Eldar were the Vanyar, the Noldor and the Teleri. All of the Vanyar and Noldor went to Aman (though many of the Noldor later returned to Middle-earth with F?nor).
 Many of the Teleri also journeyed to Valinor, but twice a host of this people turned away from the Journey in Middle-earth; these two kindreds are called ?anyar, the Eldar not of Aman.

* Elephants|Elephant
Giant beasts of the southern lands.
 While we know much of the great elephant-like creatures known as the M?akil, it is not certain whether their lesser cousins that are still known today existed in Middle-earth.

* Elessar (jewel)|Elessar
A great green jewel of healing power made in Gondolin for Idril Turgon's daughter, who gave it to E?endil her son; the Elessar that Arwen gave to Aragorn being either E?endil's jewel returned or another. Called also the Stone of E?endil and the Elfstone.

The name foretold for Aragorn by Ol?in, and the name in which he became King of the reunited realm.
-----
High title and surname of Aragorn son of Arathorn. It was long foretold that he would take this name; it was given to him in L?ien by Galadriel. She granted him a gift of a green stone set in a silver brooch in the shape of an eagle as he and the Company of the Ring left her land (on 16 February III 3019). 'In this hour,' she said, 'take the name that was foretold for you, Elessar, the Elfstone of the house of Elendil!'
 When Aragorn took up the kingship of Gondor, he assumed the name Elessar, and later references to him take the form 'King Elessar'.


* Elestirn?Elestirne
A name of the Lady Erendis.
 A name and title, more commonly seen in the form Tar-Elestirn? given to Erendis of N?enor. Elestirn?means 'star-brow', and was a reference to the bright jewel she wore bound to her forehead. This was to become a custom and symbol of royalty among the N?en?eans in later years.

 The son of Fastred of Greenholm and Sam Gamgee's eldest daughter Elanor, born in the year IV 33 (1454 by the Shire-reckoning). His name means 'Elfstone', and its connection to the royal name Elessar is no doubt more than coincidence.


* Elfstone
The green stone given to Aragorn II by Galadriel in L?ien, and the origin of his surname, Elessar.


* Elfwine the Fair|Elfwin?Elfwine
Son of ?mer King of Rohan and Loth?iel, daughter of Imrahil Prince of Dol Amroth.
-----
Rohan's nineteenth King.

* Elladan
Brother to Elrohir and Arwen.
 In the one hundred and thirtieth year of the Third Age, Celebr?n the wife of Elrond bore twin sons. Dark-haired and grey-eyed, only those that knew them well could tell them apart. The first of the twins was named Elladan, 'Elf-Man' as a token of his ancestry; he was descended not only from the royal houses of the Noldor and the Sindar, but also from the Houses of Hador and B?r of the Edain.
 Many centuries later, the twins' mother Celebr?n went on a journey into the south to visit her own mother, Galadriel, in the land of L?ien. In the Redhorn Pass, she was captured by Orcs, and tortured in their dens. Elladan rode with his brother to rescue her, but by the time they reached her she had received a poisonous wound. Though their father healed her, she would not remain in Middle-earth, and sailed into the West the following year. After this loss, Elladan and his brother Elrohir were filled with hatred of the Orcs, often riding against them with the Northern D?edain.
 In the early part of the War of the Ring, the brothers' main role was to scout the land and prepare the way for the Fellowship, but later they took a more active part. When Halbarad rode to Aragorn's aid with the Grey Company, Elladan and Elrohir accompanied them. They followed Aragorn through the Paths of the Dead, fought with him at Pelargir, and took part in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, where they fought with stars bound to their brows.
 After the War of the Ring, little is known of the brothers' fate. They returned to their father's house at Rivendell, and remained there even after he had passed across the Sea. Like their sister Arwen, the sons of Elrond Half-elven were granted the choice of whether to leave Middle-earth for the Undying Lands, or remain there and become Mortal as Men. Elladan had such a bond with his brother that they must surely have chosen alike, but what choice they made in the end can never now be known.

* Elrohir
The noble twin son of Elrond.
 With Elladan, one of the twin sons of Elrond, born in the early years of the Third Age. They performed many deeds of errantry throughout that age, and fought in the War of the Ring.
 See Elladan.


* Elrond
Son of E?endil and Elwing, who at the end of the First Age chose to belong to the Firstborn, and remained in Middle-earth until the end of the Third Age; master of Imladris (Rivendell) and keeper of Vilya, the Ring of Air, which he had received from Gil-galad. Called Master Elrond and Elrond Half-elven. The name means 'Star-dome'.
-----
Master of Rivendell.
 One of the greatest Elves in the history of Middle-earth, Elrond was born at the Havens of Sirion late in the First Age. During their sack, he and his brother Elros were taken captive by the Sons of F?nor, but Maglor took pity on them and released them. When they were rescued, Elrond was found playing in a cave beneath a waterfall, and so received his full name, meaning 'Elf of the Cave'.
 Both of Elrond's parents were Half-elven, and after the War of Wrath he was given a choice; whether to be counted amongst the kindred of Elves or of Men. He chose the Firstborn, and remained in Lindon with High King Gil-galad.
 After the invasion of Eriador by Sauron in the mid-Second Age, Elrond founded a refuge there in a deep hidden valley; this was named Imladris, or Rivendell in the Common Speech. After Sauron's defeat by Tar-Minastir of N?enor, Elrond remained in Rivendell, where he prospered with the aid of the Great Ring, Vilya.
 Elrond played a great part in the histories of the Second and Third Ages; he marched with Gil-galad and Elendil to the War of the Last Alliance, and was a leading member of the White Council. At the time of the Council of Elrond in III 3018, he had dwelt in Middle-earth for some 6,500 years.
 Meaning of the name: 'Elf of the Cave'.


* Elros
Son of E?endil and Elwing, brother of Elrond; at the end of the First Age chose to be numbered among Men, and became the first King of N?enor (called Tar-Minyatur), living to a very great age. The name means 'Star-foam'.
-----

* Elu Thingol|Elu
Sindarin form of Elw?Singollo.
-----
In his early life, millennia before the beginning of the First Age, Thingol journeyed to Valinor with Ingw?and Finw? and was returned to the Eldar who dwelt at Cuivi?en. From the travellers' reports of the Blessed Realm, many of the Elves marched westward across Middle-earth, seeking the land of the Valar, and the third and greatest host of the Elves, the Teleri, were led by Thingol and his brother Olw?
 As they neared the western coasts of Middle-earth, Thingol came upon Melian the Maia in the wood of Nan Elmoth. Long years passed, and at length he remained with Melian in Beleriand, though many of the Teleri passed West over the Great Sea. With Melian, Thingol founded the woodland realm of Doriath in the central regions of Beleriand, and there ruled the Sindar for many years. Thingol's doom came upon him when Beren brought him a Silmaril from Morgoth's crown as the bride-price of his daughter L?hien. He summoned Dwarves from the Blue Mountains to set the jewel in the necklace Nauglam?, and the Dwarves became so enamoured of their work that they slew Thingol in his own treasury.

* Elven

* Elven-rings|Elven-ring|Rings of the Elves|Ring of the Elves
The magical rings of the Elves of Eregion.
 The magical rings made by Celebrimbor and the M?dain of Eregion in the middle years of the Second Age, made unwittingly under the secret guidance and tutelage of Sauron. Most famous among them were the Three Rings of the Elves, Narya, Nenya and Vilya, the Rings of Fire, Water and Air. These were the only three made free of the influence of Sauron, though they too fell under the power of his One Ring.
 After Sauron made his Ring, he invaded the lands of the M?dain for the recovery of the Elven-rings. His armies overwhelmed Eregion, and he gathered most of the rings to himself, but four of the Great Rings were lost to him. One (later known as the Ring of Thr?) was held by Durin III, King of the impregnable Dwarf-city of Khazad-d? in the Misty Mountains. Nenya the Ring of Water was carried eastward from Eregion by Galadriel, who crossed the mountains and settled in the land of L?ien. Narya and Vilya had already been sent into the north by Celebrimbor, and were in the safekeeping of High King Gil-galad.
 Galadriel kept her Elven-ring throughout the later years of the Second Age, and the duration of the Third. Gil-galad gave his rings to lords in his service - Narya to C?dan at the Grey Havens, and Vilya to Elrond, who used it to found a haven of his own against Sauron in the midst of Eriador - Imladris, that Men came to call Rivendell. C?dan, too, passed on his Ring, to a Grey stranger who sailed into his havens out of the West, who would come to be known in later legends as Mithrandir, or Gandalf.
 With the destruction of Sauron's One Ring in the last years of the Third Age, all the other Elven-rings lost their power, including the Three. Those who had borne their power through the ages since their forging left Middle-earth together on the White Ship; Galadriel, Elrond and Gandalf, the Keepers of the Three Rings.


* Elven-smiths
The followers of Celebrimbor.
 A general term for any smith of the Elves, but in fact used almost exclusively to describe the M?dain, the jewelsmiths of Eregion led by Celebrimbor, who had a part in the making of the Rings of Power.

* Elves|Elf
The Elder Children of Il?atar.
 The first Elves awoke by Cuivi?en, the Water of Awakening in the far east of Middle-earth, long Ages before the Rising of the Sun or Moon. Unlike Men, the Elves were not subject to illness or death, and at the time of the Lord of the Rings, there were still at least two Elves in Aman who had awoken by Cuivi?en in the first days; Ingw? Lord of the Vanyar, and Olw? brother of King Elu Thingol.
-----
Origins and Early History: In the far eastern land of Cuivi?en, on the shores of the Inland Sea of Helcar and beneath the mountains of the Orocarni, the Elves awoke under the starlight of the Years of the Trees. The Valar at first knew nothing of their coming, but they were soon discovered by the spies of Melkor, who sent his creatures to watch them and harrass them.
 How long they existed in this perilous and unprotected state is not known, but the legends of those times, of the Hunter and of a dark Rider, were preserved in Valinor by the Eldar that came there. It is known that many of the ancient Elves were captured by Melkor and imprisoned in Utumno - it is generally thought that these hapless beings were the origins of the race of Orcs.
 The Valar discovered that the Elves had awoken when Orom? hunting in the lands of Middle-earth, heard their singing voices. He named them Eldar, the People of the Stars, but the Elves' own name for their kind was Quendi, those who speak with voices. Because of the horrors of Melkor, many of the Elves were at first suspicious of the Vala, but (after briefly returning to Valinor to tell the other Valar of his discovery) he remained with them and protected them for a time.
 Concerned for the safety of the Elves in Middle-earth, which was at that time under the control of Melkor, the Valar left Valinor and made war against the Dark Lord: this was the Battle of the Powers, which saw Melkor taken as captive back to Valinor.
-----
The Great Journey: After the defeat of Melkor, the Valar debated the fate of the Elves - whether they should be left to dwell in Middle-earth, or brought to Valinor to be kept under the direct protection of the Valar. It was decided to bring them to the land of the Valar, and Orom?was sent back to Cuivi?en to summon them.
 When he returned, though, he found that the Elves feared the Valar, and were reluctant to make the journey. Three ambassadors were chosen, Ingw? Finw?and Elw? to travel to Aman with Orom? and help the Elves decide on their course. These three were filled with awe by what they saw there, and by the light of the Two Trees, and counselled their people to follow the summons.
 The followers of Ingw? and most of the peoples of Finw?and Elw?agreed, and set out on the Great Journey westwards across the wide lands of Middle-earth. These were the peoples later known as the Three Kindreds, the Vanyar, the Noldor and the Teleri. Not all the Elves obeyed the summons; those who refused are known as Avari, the Unwilling.
 Orom?led the peoples of the Three Kindreds out of the east of Middle-earth. The Vanyar were the least numerous, and the most eager to reach Aman, and they came first on the Journey, followed by the Noldor of Finw?
 The Teleri, led by Elw?and his brother Olw? were the greatest host, and many were uncertain and doubtful. Not a few of these people left the Journey and remained in Middle-earth. The most notable of those who turned from the Journey were the Nandor, who were led away down the Vales of Anduin by Lenw?
 At last, the Vanyar and the Noldor reached the shores of the Great Sea, in the regions between the Bay of Balar and the Firth of Drengist (regions later known, at least for the most part, as the Falas). Ulmo brought a great island to the shores, and on it transported the Elves to Aman.
 The Teleri were the hindcomers, though, and arrived in Beleriand too late to embark on Ulmo's island. They dwelt for a while on the banks of the Gelion in eastern Beleriand, but later spread to the shores. In this time, two events of historical importance occurred - their lord Elw?was lost for a time in Nan Elmoth, and they encountered Oss? a Maia of the Sea.
 Many of the Teleri wished to remain in Beleriand, some to seek for their lost lord, and others because of desires stirred in their hearts by Oss? When the time came for Ulmo to return to Beleriand to take the Teleri to Valinor, then, many of them remained behind. These people became known in after years as the Sindar, the Grey-elves, and those who dwelt by the shores under the lordship of C?dan became known as the Falathrim.
-----
Melkor Chained - Three Ages of Bliss: Now came three ages of glory and bliss for the Elves, both east and west of the Great Sea. In Valinor, the Vanyar and the Noldor, and those of the Teleri who completed the Journey, dwelt with the Valar and learned from them. They dwelt in the jewelled city of Tirion in the Pass of Light, and at the Swanhaven of Alqualond? and beneath the tower of Avall??on the Lonely Isle of Tol Eress?. While the Two Trees still gave light to the realm of the Valar, three ages passed, and the Elves of Valinor became the wisest and noblest of all the Children of Il?atar.
 Meanwhile, in Beleriand, the Sindar dwelt beneath starlight. While most of Middle-earth still slept, awaiting the coming of the Sun and Moon, Melian the Maia brought life to the forests and plains of Beleriand under Thingol's rule, and Orom?would still ride at times across the darkling lands.
-----
The Nature of the Elves: Both Elves and Men are the Children of Il?atar, and so have much in common, but there are also great differences between the two peoples. Of these, the most significant is that Elves are 'immortal', at least while the World lasts; they do not suffer ageing or disease, and if they are slain or wither with grief, they are reincarnated in the Halls of Mandos in Valinor.
 Although, unlike Men, the Elves must remain in the world until its ending, they are not bound to Middle-earth. They may if they wish take the straight road, and sail into the Uttermost West, a road that is barred to mortals.
 Elves also have far clearer sight and perception than Men; they are naturally aware of many things that are hidden from the Younger Children, but these gifts are not without limit.
-----
Religion: The Elves never had any distinct 'religion' in the sense that Men would understand the word; indeed, the High Elves had travelled to Valinor and lived with the Valar (or 'gods') themselves for many ages before Men came into the world.
 Of all the Valar, they most revered Varda Elent?i, the spouse of Manw? and Lady of the Stars. In Middle-earth, they called her Elbereth, Star-Queen, and sang to her across the wide ocean Belegaer. Great respect was also given to Ulmo, especially during the First Age when he aided the Elves against Morgoth.


* Elves of Beleriand|Elf of Beleriand|Beleriand Elves|Beleriand Elf
The Eldar of Middle-earth in the Elder Days.
 For three ages after the departure of the Vanyar, Noldor and Teleri to Aman, the Elves who inhabited Beleriand comprised that part of the Telerin people who remained in Middle-earth, known as the Sindar or Grey-elves after their king, Thingol Greycloak of Doriath.
 At the rising of the Moon in the beginning of the First Age, many of the Noldor returned to Beleriand from Aman to make war on Morgoth. While there was some enmity between the Sindar and the Noldor (especially the Sons of F?nor), the two peoples lived together in the face of their common foe, Morgoth Bauglir.
 Finally, a small part of the Nandor, kin of the Sindar who had turned aside from the westward journey east of the Misty Mountains, entered the land of Ossiriand during the First Age. Though these people, called the Laiquendi or Green-elves, played little part in the wars against Morgoth, they are accounted a part of the Elves of Beleriand.


* Elves of Doriath|Elf of Doriath|Doriath Elves|Doriath Elf
The People of Thingol and Melian.
 Those Elves of the Sindar that lived in the broad forests of central Beleriand, Neldoreth and Region, under the Kingship of Elu Thingol. These people, whose King had travelled to Valinor in his youth, and whose Queen was of the order of the Maiar, were held to be the highest and noblest of the Grey-elven kindred.


* Elves of Eregion|Elf of Eregion|Eregion Elves|Eregion Elf
The followers of Celebrimbor son of Curufin, who with him founded a land of the Elves near to Moria in the Misty Mountains. They were destroyed by Sauron during the Second Age.

The Elves that lived beyond the Blue Mountains.
 Those Elves who dwelt in the west of Middle-earth, between the Blue Mountains and the Great Sea, in the Second and Third Ages. They reached the height of their power in the Second Age under King Gil-galad, but waned after his loss in the Siege of Barad-d?.


* Elves of L?ien|Elves of Lorien|Elf of L?ien|Elf of Lorien|L?ien Elves|Lorien Elves|L?ien Elf|Lorien Elf
The Galadhrim, the Elvish people who inhabited the land of L?ien to the east of the Misty Mountains. These were Silvan Elves, descended from the Nandor, who at the time of the War of the Ring were ruled by Celeborn and Galadriel.


* Elves of Middle-earth|Elf of Middle-earth|Middle-earth Elves|Middle-earth Elf
The ?anyar and the Noldor who returned from Aman.
 The Elves that dwelt in Middle-earth were, for the most part, those who did not start the Great Journey (the Avari), or those that fell away from it (the Silvan Elves, the Nandor and the Sindar). Of those Elves who left Middle-earth for Aman, many of the Noldor later returned, and there were still some few of this noble people to be found at the time of the War of the Ring.


* Elves of Mirkwood|Elf of Mirkwood|Mirkwood Elves|Mirkwood Elf
The Silvan followers of Thranduil and his kin.
 A colony of Silvan Elves that maintained a realm in the northern regions of Mirkwood, under the rule of Thranduil.

* Elves of Sirion|Elf of Sirion|Sirion Elves|Sirion Elf
The last exiles of Gondolin and Doriath.
 A short-lived Elven culture that grew up in the lands around the Mouths of Sirion during the last days of the First Age. Its people were Elves that had fled from the destruction of the great realms of Beleriand, especially Gondolin and Doriath. It was itself destroyed, not by Morgoth, but by the remaining Sons of F?nor who sought the Silmaril of Elwing, who dwelt with the Elves of Sirion.


* Elves of Thranduil|Elf of Thranduil|Thranduil Elves|Thranduil Elf
The Elves of the Wood.
 A people of the Silvan Elves, with whom had mingled a group of Sindar. They dwelt under the trees of Mirkwood, and during the Third Age, their leader was Thranduil son of Oropher. With the help of the Dwarves, Thranduil delved an underground dwelling after the manner of his ancient kinsman Thingol at Menegroth. There, in the northeast of the Wood, the Elves of Thranduil lived in relative safety until the time of the War of the Ring. Prominent among this people was Legolas Greenleaf, who travelled with the Company of the Ring.


* Elves of the Havens|Elf of the Havens
The followers of C?dan during the First Age.
 A Sindarin people occupying the land of the Falas in western Beleriand, on the shores of Belegaer. C?dan the Shipwright was their lord, and their great cities were the Havens of Brithombar and Eglarest.
 The Elves of the Havens enjoyed peaceful relations with all the Elves of Beleriand, and were particularly closely allied with the people of Nargothrond. As one of the most remote peoples from Morgoth's forces in Angband, the other Elvish lords would often send their children to the Elves of the Havens for safekeeping.
 After the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, Brithombar and Eglarest were besieged and taken by Morgoth's armies, and most of the Elves were slain or imprisoned. Some few, including C?dan and the young Ereinion Gil-galad, who was at that time lodging with the people of the Havens, sailed south to safety on the Isle of Balar.
 At the beginning of the Second Age, C?dan sailed east to found the Grey Havens on the Gulf of Lh?, and the remnant of the Elves of the Havens must surely have accompanied him.


* Elves of the Light|Elf of the Light
The Calaquendi.
 Those Elves known as the Calaquendi, who had looked on the light of the Two Trees of Valinor before their Darkening. These were the Vanyar, the Noldor and that part of the Teleri that had travelled West from Middle-earth. Elu Thingol was also considered an Elf of the Light, because although he never completed the Great Journey, he had travelled to Valinor and back before the Eldar set out from Cuivi?en.

A name for the Sindar or Grey-elves.


* Elves of the Wood|Elf of the Wood|Wood Elves|Wood Elf

* Elvish
The rich and ancient languages of the Elves.
 A general term for the languages of the Elves. In Middle-earth, it most commonly refers to Sindarin, but can also apply to Quenya, the High-elven tongue. Other Elvish languages in Middle-earth include dialects derived from Sindarin (for example, the language of the Wood-elves of Thranduil).


* Elw?Singollo|Elw?Elwe
Surnamed Singollo 'Greymantle'; leader with his brother Olw?of the hosts of the Teleri on the westward journey from Cuivi?en, until he was lost in Nan Elmoth; afterwards Lord of the Sindar, ruling in Doriath with Melian; received the Silmaril from Beren; slain in Menegroth by the Dwarves.

-----
The daughter of Dior Eluch? and wife of E?endil the Mariner. Through the power of Ulmo she escaped the destruction of the Havens of Sirion in the form of a white bird, and came to her husband on the Sea with a Silmaril on her breast.
 Elwing's name, 'star-spray' comes from the starlight glinting on the waterfall of Lanthir Lamath, at her father's house in Ossiriand, on the night she was born.


* Emeldir

'(Princess) Shepherdess', name given to Tar-Ancalim?in her youth.


* Empty Lands
An unknown region to the east of Middle-earth.
 A mysterious region mentioned only once by Tolkien. The Empty Lands are important because they apparently lay beyond the eastern boundaries of Middle-earth, and so give a vital clue to the structure of Arda.


* Emyn Arnen
The central uplands of Ithilien.
 A range of hills in the central regions of Ithilien, across the Great River from Minas Tirith. This region was particularly associated with the Stewards of Gondor. H?in, the first of the hereditary Stewards, came from these hills, and Steward Faramir dwelt here after the War of the Ring.

'Dark Mountains', the Mountains of Mirkwood. See Emyn-nu-Fuin.
-----
The Dark Mountains of Greenwood the Great.
 The former name for the range of hills that ran west to east through the northern parts of the forest of Greenwood the Great. At the beginning of the second millennium of the Third Age, a shadow began to fall across the Forest, and across the Dark Mountains, too. Then they gained a new name, Emyn-nu-Fuin, translated as the 'Mountains of Mirkwood'.

-----
The Mountains of Mirkwood.
 The Elvish name for the east-west range of high forested hills that ran through northern Mirkwood. The name Emyn-nu-Fuin literally means 'hills under shadow', but the name is connected to the Elvish name for the Forest, Taur-nu-Fuin, and so is usually translated 'Mountains of Mirkwood'.


* Enchanted Isles
The islands set by the Valar in the Great Sea eastwards of Tol Eress? at the time of the Hiding of Valinor. See Shadowy Isles.
-----
Entrapments of the western seas.

* Enchanted River
The black river of northern Mirkwood.
 The dark river that rose in the Mountains of Mirkwood, and flowed northwards in a great loop to meet the Forest River under the canopy of the trees of Mirkwood. Its water was black, and carried a curse that gave the river its name - any person coming into contact with its enchanted water immediately fell into a long, deep sleep.
 About halfway along its length, the Enchanted River flowed across the Elf-path that led west to east through Mirkwood to Thranduil's halls, and it seems that a ferry was maintained there, presumably for the use of the Wood-elves. At least, Bilbo and the Dwarves found a boat kept on the eastern bank of the River, which they used to cross it on their journey to Erebor.

The protective mountains of Gondolin.

Called the Dark Elf; the great smith who dwelt in Nan Elmoth, and took Aredhel Turgon's sister to wife; friend of the Dwarves; maker of the sword Anglachel (Gurthang); father of Maeglin; put to death in Gondolin.
-----
The Dark Elf.
 Originally a member of the royal house of Doriath, and kin to Thingol himself, E? was unhappy in his native land. When the Girdle of Melian was placed around the forests of Doriath, E? took his leave, and went to dwell in the dark forest of Nan Elmoth, east of his homeland.
 E? was a skilful craftsman and master swordsmith. Among his greatest works were two swords made from the iron of a meteorite, Anglachel and Anguirel. Anglachel he gave to Thingol as payment for dwelling in Nan Elmoth, and it would later become the sword borne by T?in Turambar. E?'s smithcraft was especially admired by the Dwarves, and he shared a rare friendship with the Dwarves of Nogrod and Belegost in the Blue Mountains.
 One day in the early fourth century of the First Age, E? came upon a gleaming white figure in his woods. This was Aredhel, the sister of Turgon, who had travelled out of Gondolin and become lost. E? used his enchantments to draw her deeper into the wood and ensnare her. She became his wife, and bore him a son, Maeglin.
 One midsummer, many years later, E? travelled into the Blue Mountains to feast with the Dwarves of Nogrod, and returned home to find that his wife and son had left two days earlier. Mounting a horse, he gave chase, and eventually discovered them at the ford called the Brithiach. Realizing that Aredhel was returning to Gondolin with his son, E? followed them. He found his way to the Dry River, and that secret way led him to the gates of Gondolin itself. There he was captured and taken to the King.
 Turgon at first welcomed E? as a kinsman, but under the King's law one who had found the way to the Hidden City was not permitted to leave, on pain of death. Enraged at the loss of his freedom, E? chose death, for himself and his son, and cast a poisoned javelin at Maeglin. Aredhel took the dart instead, and soon passed away. In this way E? achieved the end he had sought; in punishment for his crime, the Gondolindrim cast him over the dark cliffs of the Caragd?.


* ?mer ?dig|?mer|Eomer
Nephew and fosterson of King Th?den; at the time of the War of the Ring Third Marshal of the Mark; after Th?den's death eighteenth King of Rohan; friend of King Elessar.
-----
First of the Third Line of the Kings of Rohan.
 The son of ?mund of Eastfold and Th?dwyn, the sister of King Th?den. While still a young man of just twenty-six, ?mer the King's nephew was made Third Marshal of Riddermark, and took command of the Riders of Eastfold. The days of his youth were harsh ones for Rohan; its people were imperilled by Orcs out of the north, while a certain Gr?a son of G?m?, later found to be a spy of Saruman, gained influence over the King.
 On 25 February III 3019, Rohan suffered its greatest blow to date; at a skirmish that would become known as the First Battle of the Fords of Isen, Th?den's son and heir Th?dred was slain by Saruman's forces, leaving ?mer - who was not at the battle - as the natural heir to Rohan's throne. It was five days later that the tide began to turn in Rohan's favour, when ?mer came across three strangers travelling through the fields of the Mark. These strangers were Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, and from ?mer's wise decision to aid these three came Rohan's ultimate victory.
 Because of this, some days later, Gandalf came to Edoras and healed the King of his malaise. The Rohirrim went to war, and though they were defeated at the Second Battle of the Fords of Isen, they held their own at the Battle of the Hornburg and, with the aid of the Ents of Fangorn Forest, defeated Saruman's armies. Then ?mer rode with his King to the aid of Minas Tirith, where they fought in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. There Th?den met his end, and granted ?mer the Kingship, first of the Third Line of the Kings of Rohan.
 At the time of the great victories of that year, ?mer was still just twenty-eight years old. He would rule the Rohirrim for another sixty-five years, through which he maintained a great friendship with Gondor. Such was the plenty and peace of his reign that he was given the surname ?dig, 'Blessed'. He was succeeded by his son Elfwine.

* Ereinion Gil-galad|Ereinion|Gil-galad

The last High King of the Noldor.
 Sixth and last of the High Kings of the Noldor. The only son of High King Fingon, Gil-galad was born late in the First Age, and was still a child at the time of the Dagor Bragollach; his father sent him to C?dan at the Havens for safekeeping when Morgoth broke the Siege of Angband in that battle.
 Fingon was lost in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, but the crown passed to Gil-galad's uncle Turgon in Gondolin, rather than Gil-galad himself (presumably because of his youth at that time). When Gondolin was lost, Gil-galad received the Kingship of the Noldor; he dwelt with the Exiles of the city at the Mouths of Sirion during the remainder of the First Age.
 After the destruction of Beleriand during the War of Wrath, Gil-galad founded a kingdom in Lindon in the far northwest of Middle-earth, between the Blue Mountains and the Great Sea. There he and his people prospered, until Sauron returned; he came first to Lindon in the form of Annatar, the Lord of Gifts, but Gil-galad and C?dan rejected him. Soon after, the One Ring was forged, and there was war in Middle-earth between the Elves and Sauron.
 After the Downfall of N?enor, Elendil and his sons came to Middle-earth and formed an alliance with Gil-galad, the Last Alliance of Elves and Men. They marched on Mordor and besieged Sauron's Dark Tower. Sauron was defeated, but Gil-galad met his death in that war.

* Fallohides|Fallohide
The northern branch of hobbit-kind.
 One of three original divisions of hobbit-kind, along with the Harfoots and Stoors. The Fallohides were the least numerous of the three branches, and originally dwelt in the northern parts of Middle-earth.
-----
The Nature of the Fallohides: In appearance, Fallohides were taller and slimmer of build than the other Hobbits, with some growing to four feet or more in height. Both their skin and their hair tended to be fair, and no Fallohide ever grew a beard.
 Fallohidish culture was much more open to outside influence than that of the Stoors or Harfoots; they were friendlier with the other races of Middle-earth than their cousins, especially the Elves. Perhaps because of this, they were skilled in both song and speech.
 While the other two branches of hobbit-kind were pastoral and rustic in nature, the Fallohides retained a hunting tradition, and so were naturally bolder and more inquisitive than their relatives, but less gifted in the arts of farming and agriculture.
-----
The History of the Fallohides: The Fallohides seem to have dwelt originally on the upper reaches of the River Anduin, in the region where the Greylin and the Langwell flowed into the Great River. It is likely that they mixed with the ancestors of the Rohirrim at this time, for the Northmen also dwelt in this region, and this is likely the origin of the legend of the holbytlan found in Rohan.
 At the end of the first millennium of the Third Age, evil things began to stir in the east of Middle-earth, and many peoples, including the ancestral Hobbits, began to travel westward across the Misty Mountains. The first Hobbits to enter Eriador were the Harfoots; the Fallohides deserted their northern homes in around III 1150, and crossed the Mountains to the north of Rivendell, at the sources of the River Hoarwell.
 The tribes of the Fallohidish Hobbits travelled slowly down the course of the Hoarwell, and westward across Eriador. They eventually settled in the region around Bree, in c.III 1300, where their adventurous and intrepid natures made them natural leaders of the other Hobbits they found there. It was presumably at about this time that the three strains of Hobbits began to mix freely for the first time.
 Three hundred years later (in the year 1601 of the Third Age), two Fallohide brothers, Marcho and Blanco, travelled westward again from Bree with their followers and crossed the Bridge of Stonebows (later the Brandywine Bridge). They settled in the empty land that they found there and were granted it by King Argeleb II of Arthedain, in whose realm it lay. This was the land that was to become known as the Shire.
 As the centuries passed, the three distinct strains of the Hobbits gradually began to disappear as they mingled with one another in the Shire. Nonetheless, there were families that retained a strong line of Fallohidish blood, and the impetuosity that went with it. At the time of the War of the Ring, the Fallohidish line was still well represented in the families of the Tooks and the Brandybucks.

* Father of Dragons
A title given to Glaurung, the first and greatest of the Dragons. Whether Glaurung was literally the father of all dragons, as for example Durin was father of all his folk, is unknown; the origins of dragon-kind remain mysterious.

-----
Greatest of the Noldor.
 Eldest son of Finw? lord of the Noldor, and half-brother to Fingolfin and Finarfin, F?nor was accounted the greatest of the Deep Elves. In Valinor, he captured the light of the Two Trees to make the three Silmarils. When Melkor stole these, and slew his father Finw? he rebelled against the Valar and led the greater part of the Noldor into Middle-earth, swearing in the dreadful Oath of F?nor that he would not rest until the Great Jewels were recovered.
 On his return to Middle-earth, F?nor immediately drove onward to Angband, though outnumbered greatly by Morgoth's Orcs and Balrogs. He was slain at last by Gothmog, the Lord of Balrogs, and such was the ferocity of his spirit that after his death, his body was consumed by flame.

* Felar?|Felarof
The horse of Eorl the Young.
-----
The great horse of Eorl.
 Eorl's father L?d was a tamer of horses among the ?th?d, who captured this wild white horse while it was still a foal. He tried to tame it himself, but when he attempted to mount it, it threw him and escaped. So L?d died, leaving a sixteen-year-old son, Eorl. Eorl hunted the white horse, found it, and demanded that it give up its freedom in payment for the death of his father. The horse agreed, and took the name that Eorl gave it: Felar?, a name said to mean 'very valiant' or 'very strong'.
 It was on Felar? that Eorl rode to the aid of Gondor and earned a famous victory, one that would lead Steward Cirion to grant them the wide empty land of Calenardhon, which would come to be called Rohan. For more than thirty years afterwards, Felar? had the freedom of those wide grasslands, but a new invasion of Easterlings saw Eorl ride to battle once again. In the Wold, the far northern reach of Rohan, Eorl and Felar? met their ends, and were laid together in a mound raised outside the gate of Edoras.
 Felar? was a very remarkable horse indeed. It is even recorded that he could understand the speech of Men. He gave rise in turn to a race of wonderful horses, the Mearas, who according to tradition could only be ridden by the Lords of the Mark, Eorl's descendants. It was from this line that Gandalf's horse Shadowfax came, making him a descendant of Felar? himself.

* Fen of Serech|Serech
The great fen north of the Pass of Sirion, where the river Rivil flowed in from Dorthonion.
-----
Scene of Barahir's rescue of Finrod.
 The Fen of Serech lay on the upper course of the mighty River Sirion, at the inflowing of its tributary, the Rivil. Lying as it did at the mouth of one of the few passes in the northern mountains of Beleriand, the Fen played a part in many battles, and had a long and bloody history.
 This history started at the very beginning of the First Age, in the Dagor-nuin-Giliath, which saw a great victory for the Elves over the forces of Morgoth. As the remnant of the Orc armies fled back from the Falas, Celegorm rode down from the hills around Eithel Sirion and drove them into the waters of Serech.
 In I 455, at the Dagor Bragollach, Finrod Felagund found himself cut off in the Fen with a small host. He seemed lost, but was rescued with great loss by Barahir and escaped back to Nargothrond. This was the beginning of the great friendship between Finrod and the kin of Barahir, and Finrod gave Barahir his ring in token of this.
 The Elves' counter-attack, the battle that became the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, was made sixteen years later. King Fingon drew up his battle-line along the upper course of the Sirion, between the Fen and the fortress of Barad Eithel. It was here that the heralds of Morgoth tortured Gelmir before the Elven host, and Gwindor his brother broke ranks, driving into the Orc host seeking his revenge, and starting the great battle.
 Later, as the battle drew to a close, Turgon and the host of Gondolin were forced back across the Fen. H?in and Huor, with the Men of the House of Hador made a stand there on the banks of the Rivil, allowing Turgon to escape the ruin of the Elves and reach Gondolin. Huor and his men were slain one by one by the Orcs, but H?in slayed seventy of the enemy before being captured.
 After twenty-eight years of torture, Morgoth released H?in and set a watch upon him. H?in's first act was to seek out the hidden city of Gondolin, but Turgon was suspicious and ignored his cries; 'Turgon, Turgon, remember the Fen of Serech'.

 The son of Thain Fortinbras II and Lalia Clayhanger, who inherited the Thainship from his father. It was during his time as Shire-thain that Bilbo Baggins' famous Birthday Party was held, and though he is not mentioned in detailed accounts of the Party, we do know that he was present. He died in the year III 3015, just three years before Frodo set out from the Shire. He left no heir, and the succession passed to his distant cousin Paladin.

-----
The second son of Finw?and half-brother to F?nor. After F?nor's death, his eldest son Maedhros should have become High King of the Noldor, but Maedhros repented his deeds at the Kinslaying and refused the title, which thus passed to Fingolfin.
 He ruled the lands to the northwest of Beleriand with his sons Fingon and Turgon, and dwelt behind the mountain fences of Hithlum during the long Siege of Angband.
 When Morgoth broke the Siege in the Dagor Bragollach, Fingolfin was prevented from sending immediate help to the other princes of the Noldor by the ferocity of the onslaught, but when heard of the extent of their defeat, he rode in anger to the doors of Angband and demanded single combat with Morgoth. There they fought a mighty battle, but though Fingolfin wounded the Dark Lord, he could not prevail, and was finally crushed by Morgoth's hammer, Grond. His body was saved, though, by Thorondor, who bore it to a peak in the Encircling Mountains. Turgon came there and built a cairn over his father's remains.

Founder and King of Nargothrond, whence his name Felagund 'cave-hewer'; encountered in Ossiriand the first Men to cross the Blue Mountains; rescued by Barahir in the Dagor Bragollach; redeemed his oath to Barahir by accompanying Beren on his quest; slain in defence of Beren in the dungeons of Tol-in-Gaurhoth.

* Finw?Finwe

-----
Ancient lord of the Noldor.
 The first High King of the Noldor, and father to the three royal houses of that people. Finw?awoke with the first Elves at Cuivi?en, the Water of Awakening. When the Valar summoned the Elves to dwell with them in Valinor, he was chosen, with Ingw?and Elw? to travel there as ambassadors. When he returned, he led the Noldor in their great westward journey across the lands of Middle-earth and the Great Sea to Aman.
 Under Finw?s rule the Noldor dwelt for at least three ages (about 9,000 years) in Valinor, and learned much from the Valar, especially Aul?the Smith. During this time, he dwelt in Tirion, but afterwards his eldest son F?nor withdrew to his fortress of Formenos, and Finw?went to dwell there also.
 After the Darkening of Valinor, Melkor stormed Formenos seeking the Silmarils, which were held in its vaults. He slew Finw?before its doors and stole the Jewels of F?nor. After his death, the kingship of the Noldor was briefly bestowed on his son F?nor.

* Fire of Orodruin
A common epithet for the flames of Orodruin, into which the One Ring was to be cast.


* Fire-drakes|Fire-drake
Fire-breathing Dragons.
 The more powerful of the two fundamental divisions of dragon-kind, who, as the name suggests, were able to breathe fire. Glaurung, Ancalagon and Smaug were all fire-drakes.
 Almost nothing specific is known about this type of dragon; the only explicit reference is in The Silmarillion (Of the Return of the Noldor); 'Again after a hundred years Glaurung, the first of the Urul?i, the fire-drakes of the North, issued from Angband's gates by night'.
 Other references, however, indicate that fire-breathing was an ability that some dragons possessed, and others (the Cold-drakes) lacked. In a literal sense, then, the later fire-breathers such as Smaug were indeed 'fire drakes'.


* Fire-mountain
A name for Orodruin.
 A rarely-used term for the volcano Orodruin in the land of Mordor, where the One Ring was forged. 'Fire-mountain' is a literal translation of the name 'Orodruin'.

* First Age
The Age of the Wars of Beleriand.
 First, and shortest by far, of the Four Ages chronicled by Tolkien. Unlike the Second and Third Ages, there is no detailed chronicle of the events of the First Age, and so dates must be inferred from references in the text - hence many dates in this Age (including the year in which it ended) are necessarily approximate. The First Age began with the Return of the Noldor to Middle-earth, the first rising of the Moon and the Sun, and the Awakening of Men in Hild?ien. It ended with the War of Wrath, the destruction of Beleriand and the final defeat of Morgoth. The end of the First Age was marked by the return of many of the Noldor, accompanied also by many Sindarin Elves, into the West to dwell on Tol Eress?.
-----
Key Events of the First Age:
- 1: Return of the Noldor; Dagor-nuin-Giliath; Awakening of Men.
- c. 75: Dagor Aglareb.
- 126: Completion of Gondolin.
- c. 305: Arrival of Men in Beleriand.
- 455: Dagor Bragollach.
- 465: Beren and L?hien achieve the Quest of the Silmaril.

* First Battle
The first of the five great battles in the Wars of Beleriand, fought soon after the destruction of the Two Trees of Valinor, and before the Return of the Noldor to Middle-earth. On his return, Melkor loosed legions of Orcs upon Thingol and C?dan, at that time the two greatest lords of Beleriand. Though the Elves managed to save both their kingdoms of Doriath and the Falas, the Orcs roamed Beleriand freely after this battle until the coming of the Noldor.


* First Eastfarthing Troop
The Shirriffs of Frogmorton.
 A troop of Shirriffs formed during the troubled times in the Shire under the rule of Saruman. The troop was based in the Shirriff-house at Frogmorton on the East Road. It was the First Eastfarthing Troop that attempted to arrest Frodo and the Travellers on their journey to Bag End.

* Flame of Anor
A power wielded by Gandalf.
-----
"'You cannot pass,' he said. The Orcs stood still, and a dead silence fell. 'I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. You cannot pass."
(Gandalf's challenge to the Balrog, from The Fellowship of the Ring II 5, The Bridge of Khazad-d?)
-----
A mysterious power claimed by Gandalf in the face of Durin's Bane. It is nowhere else referred to, and so its particular meaning remains unclear. Anor is the Sun, and so literally the 'flame of Anor' would be the light of the Sun, the fiery fruit of Laurelin, one of the Two Trees of Valinor. Gandalf seems to be referring, then, to the power he gains as a servant of the Lords of the West, in defiance to the corrupted darkness of the Balrog.


* Flame of the West

 Title and literal translation of the name of Aragorn's sword, And?il, reforged from Elendil's sword Narsil.

* Folco Boffin|Folco

-----
A region of the King's Lands of Rohan.
 An ancient and historic region of Rohan, close to the King's courts in Edoras, which indeed originally held the King's seat at the town of Aldburg. Its name comes from Old English, with the approximate meaning 'bosom of the Earth', which shows its importance in Rohan's early history.

* Fords of Isen
Crossing of the Isen by the great N?en?ean road linking Gondor and Arnor; called in Sindarin Athrad Angren and Ethraid Engrin.
-----
The crossing-point on the upper reaches of the River Isen. As the only direct route between Eriador and Gondor, the Fords had great strategic value, and Isengard was built to guard them. They were the scene of two Battles between Saruman and the Rohirrim during the War of the Ring.


* Fords of Poros|Fords of the Poros
Crossing of the river Poros on the Harad Road.
-----
The gateway to Ithilien.
 More often called the 'Crossings of Poros', the Fords marked the point where the Harad Road from Harad and South Gondor entered the lands of Gondor proper. As such, their strategic importance was considerable, as attacking armies from the south had no choice but to cross the Poros at this point.
 The Fords first enter history in the year III 1944, when the enemies of Gondor made an alliance, and all attacked simultaneously, from the northeast and from the south. It was left to the great general E?nil (later King E?nil II) to deal with the army of Harad approaching from the south. Rather than defend the Fords (as no doubt the Haradrim expected he would), E?nil positioned his army some forty miles further north, in South Ithilien, and decimated the encroaching enemy.
 Though Gondor survived that assault with great loss, the land was often threatened by the Haradrim. In III 2885, the fierce people of that southern land occupied South Gondor and attacked Ithilien across the Poros. Steward T?in II was aided in his defence by King Folcwine of Rohan, whose twin sons Folcred and Fastred rode with his army. These two northern armies forced the Haradrim back across the Fords and had the victory, but the sons of Folcwine both fell in that battle.
 The Rohirrim buried the twins in a great mound, after their custom, and that mound, the Haudh in Gwanur, guarded Gondor's southern boundaries for long years after.


* Forelithe

 The sixth month of the Shire Calendar, lying between Thrimidge and the midsummer feastdays of Lithe, and approximately equivalent to modern June. In fact, it ran from modern 22 May to 20 June.


* Forest River
River flowing from Ered Mithrin through northern Mirkwood and into the Long Lake.
-----
The river of northern Mirkwood.
 A river so-named because for much of its length it ran through northern Mirkwood. It rose in the Grey Mountains to the north of the Forest, and followed a roughly southeasterly course to its outflow into the Long Lake.


* Forest Road
The road that ran through Mirkwood.
 The road that ran down from the High Pass, crossed the River Anduin and then plunged among the trees of Greenwood the Great (later called Mirkwood).

* Forlindon
The lands of the Elves north of the Gulf of Lh?.
 After the end of the First Age, the land of Lindon, west of the Blue Mountains, was divided by the great Gulf of Lh?. The greater northern part was named Forlindon, which means no more than 'North-Lindon' in the Elven-tongue.

 The lands farther north, toward the Cape, became rockier and more mountainous. In the far north was a region around the peak of Sorontil, where the landscape fell sheer into the sea forming tremendous cliffs. This was the abode of Eagles, and also the dwelling-place of Meneldur Elentirmo, heir to N?enor's throne and a watcher of the stars, who built a great tower here to follow the movements of the heavens.

He was just two years old when his uncle Bandobras beat off a raiding band of Orcs in the Battle of Greenfields. He took on the Thainship more than fifty years later, by which time the Shire had settled into a more peaceful way of life - at least, it was unaffected by outside events during his forty-seven years as Thain.

The Fourth Age was held to have begun with the passing of the Ring-bearers over the sea from Mithlond on 29 September III 3021, though in Gondor it was reckoned as beginning on 25 March of the same year (the second anniversary of the Downfall of Barad-d?).

-----
Life in the Shire, III 2968 - III 3018: Frodo's father, Drogo, had left Hobbiton and removed to Buckland to live with his wife's family, and so Frodo was raised in Brandy Hall, the ancestral home of the Brandybucks. He lost both his parents in a boating accident in 2980. He was close to his distant cousin Bilbo, and nine years after the loss of his parents, Bilbo officially adopted him as his heir. At this time, Frodo moved back from Buckland to Hobbiton.
 Although Bilbo often referred to Frodo as his 'favourite nephew', he was in fact his first cousin once removed (through his mother), and also his second cousin once removed (through his father).
 Frodo lived with Bilbo at Bag End for twelve years, and inherited some of his peculiarities. It was said that he would meet with Elves in the woods, for example, and Bilbo allowed him to read his diary of the journey to Erebor.
 In 3001, Bilbo held the great Birthday Party on 22 September (a birthday Frodo happened to share) and afterwards departed from the Shire, leaving Frodo to come into his inheritance, including (after much persuasion by Gandalf) the Ring.
 After Bilbo's departure, Gandalf visited Hobbiton only occasionally. Frodo often went walking in the Shire, sometimes with his friends Folco Boffin, Fredegar Bolger, Peregrin Took and Meriadoc Brandybuck, but more often alone. His gardener at Bag End was Samwise Gamgee, who was to accompany him on his great journey.
 On 12 April 3018, Gandalf returned, having discovered the truth about the Ring, and so Frodo discovered the history behind the One Ring, and the great danger it held. He resolved to leave the Shire with it.
 To cover his departure, Frodo sold Bag End to Lobelia Sackville-Baggins, and bought a small house at Crickhollow in Buckland, the region where he had been brought up. He departed from Hobbiton with Peregrin Took and Sam Gamgee on 23 September 3018, the day after his fiftieth birthday.


* Frodo Gardner
Second child and eldest son of Samwise Gamgee and Rose Cotton; named for Frodo Baggins of the Company of the Ring.


* Frogmorton
Home of The Floating Log.
 A village in the Eastfarthing of the Shire. It stood on the East Road, between the Three-farthing Stone (fourteen miles to the west) and the Brandywine Bridge (twenty-two miles to the east). Immediately to the north of the village, the stream known as the Water broke into two, creating a wide watery region - this feature seems to have given Frogmorton its name, which means 'frog marsh'.
 Until the War of the Ring, the village seems to have been most notable for its inn, the Floating Log. During the brief time when Saruman took over the Shire, though, it became the home of the First Eastfarthing Troop of Shirriffs, and it was here that the returning Ring-bearers were 'arrested' on their journey back to Hobbiton.


* Front Gate
A common term for the main gate of the Dwarf-citadel of Erebor.


* Fr?|Fror
The son of D?n I of Durin's Folk, and brother to Thr? the founder of Erebor. He was slain with his father by a Cold-drake in the Grey Mountains.


* Frumgar
Leader of the northward migration of the ?th?d out of the Vales of Anduin.
-----
A chieftain of the Northmen and ancestor of Eorl the Young, who led his people to ?h?d on the upper reaches of the Anduin.


* Fuinur
A renegade N?en?ean who became mighty among the Haradrim at the end of the Second Age.
-----
A N?en?ean lord of the Haradrim.
 A Man of N?enor who fell under the influence of Sauron during the time the Dark Lord dwelt on that island. He sailed east to Middle-earth, apparently with a companion named Herumor, and settled in the southern region known as the Harad. These two became lords in Middle-earth, coming to hold power among the Haradrim.


* Fundin
The father of Balin.
 A Dwarf of the royal house of the Longbeards, the great-grandson of King N?n II. He fathered two sons, Balin and Dwalin, who would later travel to Erebor with Bilbo Baggins. Fundin was killed beneath the East-gate of Moria in the Battle of Azanulbizar.


* Gabilgathol
The Dwarves' own name for their city of Belegost.
 The Dwarf-citadel that lay near Mount Dolmed in the Blue Mountains. More commonly known by its Elvish name, Belegost.


* Gaffer Gamgee|Gaffer
A common nickname for the father of Samwise Gamgee, who was more properly called 'Hamfast'. He presumably acquired the name 'Gaffer' later in his life, because it implies a person of advanced years. This was certainly true of Hamfast, who was old enough to remember Bilbo's return from Erebor, and was no less than ninety-two years old when his son Sam left the Shire with Frodo.
 'Gaffer' has another meaning, too, which is no doubt also relevant. In British slang, a 'gaffer' is a foreman, a person who supervises a job. At the time of Bilbo's Birthday Party, we're told that Hamfast, who was then seventy-five, oversaw the gardening at Bag End, but was helped by his son Sam. In that sense, then, Gaffer Gamgee actually was a 'gaffer'.


* Galadhon
Father of Celeborn.
-----
A noble Elf of Doriath, the son of Elmo and thus the nephew of Thingol himself. Little is known of him, except for the fact that he was father to Celeborn, later Lord of L?ien.


* Galadhriel
A rare later name of Galadriel.
 A name occasionally used of Galadriel after she became Lady of L?ien, meaning 'tree-garland'.


* Galadhrim

 The 'tree-people'; the Silvan Elves of the land of L?ien, ruled in the later Third Age by Galadriel and Celeborn.


* Galador
First Lord of Dol Amroth, son of Imraz? the N?en?ean and the Elf Mithrellas.
-----
The first Prince of Dol Amroth.
 The son of Imraz? the N?en?ean and (at least, according to legend) the Elf-maid Mithrellas, Galador became the first Prince of Dol Amroth. He established himself as lord of Belfalas in southern Gondor, a title that his descendants maintained until at least the early Fourth Age.


* Galadriel|Lady of the Noldor
Daughter of Finarfin and sister of Finrod Felagund; one of the leaders of the Noldorin rebellion against the Valar; wedded Celeborn of Doriath and with him remained in Middle-earth after the end of the First Age; keeper of Nenya, the Ring of Water, in Lothl?ien.
-----
Lady of L?ien.
 Youngest child, and only daughter, of Finarfin of the Noldor, Galadriel was born in Valinor while the Two Trees still grew there. She travelled to Middle-earth at the beginning of the First Age with her four brothers. In Beleriand, she went often to the halls of Thingol, (to whom she was related; E?wen her mother was Thingol's niece), and there she met Celeborn.
 After the War of Wrath and the destruction of Beleriand, most of the Noldor returned to Valinor, but Galadriel and Celeborn remained in Middle-earth. After the loss of Amroth in III 1981, Galadriel and Celeborn became Lady and Lord of Lothl?ien, and there they dwelt until the end of the Third Age.
 Her name means 'Radiant Garland' (referring to her hair).


* Galathil
Brother of Celeborn and father of Nimloth the mother of Elwing.
-----
A descendant of Thingol's brother Elmo, and himself the brother of Celeborn the Lord of L?ien. His daughter Nimloth wedded Dior, Thingol's Heir, and so Galathil was a distant ancestor of both Elrond and Aragorn.


* Galathilion|White Tree
The 'White Tree of Tirion', the image of Telperion made by Yavanna for the Vanyar and the Noldor.
-----
The White Tree of Tirion.
 The White Tree made by Yavanna for the Elves of the city of Tirion. From it came Celeborn, the White Tree of Tol Eress?, through which it became the ancestor of all the White Trees of N?enor and Middle-earth.


* Galdor (Elf of the Grey Havens)|Galdor
An Elf of C?dan's people.
 An Elf of the Grey Havens, who was sent by his master C?dan on an errand to Elrond's house at Rivendell. He thereby entered history, as he was present at the Council of Elrond and took part in the debate that decided the fate of the One Ring.


* Galdor (Lord of Dor-l?in)|Galdor
Called the Tall; son of Hador L?indol and lord of Dor-l?in after him; father of H?in and Huor; slain at Eithel Sirion.
-----
Lord of Dor-l?in and father to H?in and Huor.


* G?m?|Galmod
The father of Gr?a Wormtongue.
 According to Gandalf, G?m? was the father of Gr?a Wormtongue, advisor to King Th?den of Rohan. Tolkien only ever mentions him once, and then only in passing, so almost nothing is known about him. His name seems to derive from the Old English for 'lewd' or 'wanton'.


* Galvorn
The metal devised by E?.
-----
The black metal of E? the Dark Elf.
 The shining black metal devised by E?, said to be as hard as steel, but supple and malleable. E?'s armour was made of his galvorn, whose name comes from Elvish words meaning 'shining' and 'black'.


* Gamgee Family|Gamgee

* Gamil Zirak
Called the Old; Dwarf smith, master of Telchar of Nogrod.
-----
The master of Telchar the smith.
 A Dwarvish smith, the master of Telchar of Nogrod, the maker of many renowned works. Gamil Zirak was a great craftsman himself, and the treasuries of Thingol were known to hold examples of his work.


* Gammidge Family|Gammidge
An ancestral family name of the Gamgees.
 A short-lived family name of the Shire-hobbits; indeed, Hob Gammidge is the only recorded Hobbit to use the name. It was a corruption of the name of his family's original home, the village of Gamwich. The name was further corrupted when Hob acquired the nickname 'Old Gammidgy', which in turn gave rise to the family name 'Gamgee'.


* Gammidgy
The original form of the name Gamgee.
 A Hobbit family-name, apparently first used in 'Old Gammidgy', the nickname of Hob Gammidge of Tighfield. His son, Hobson, received the name in a slightly corrupted form. He became known as Roper Gamgee, and that form of the name that descended to his grandson Sam.


* Gamwich
A village in the Shire, from which the earliest members of the Gamgee family came.


* Gamwich Family|Gamwich
The ancestors of the Gamgees.
 A family of Hobbits who took their name from the village where they lived, Gamwich in the Shire. Over the years, as the family spread to other parts of the Shire, the name became corrupted, so at the time of the War of the Ring, their descendants living in Hobbiton were known as the Gamgees.


* Gandalf
One of the Istari (Wizards), member of the Fellowship of the Ring. Gandalf ('Elf of the Wand') was his name among Northern Men. See Ol?in, Mithrandir, Inc?us, Thark?, Greyhame.
-----
The Grey Pilgrim.
 In origin a Maia of Manw?and Varda, Gandalf came to the northwest of Middle-earth after a thousand years of the Third Age had passed, with four others of his order. At the Grey Havens, C?dan entrusted him with the Red Ring, Narya, to aid him in contesting the will of Sauron.
 Gandalf wandered widely in Middle-earth, and learned much of its races and peoples. Unlike his fellow Wizards Saruman and Radagast, he never settled in a single place. He was instrumental in the victory of the War of the Ring, but during that conflict his body was destroyed by a Balrog, and his spirit returned into the West. The Valar sent him back to Middle-earth to complete his task.
 Gandalf finally left Middle-earth in III 3021, when he departed over the sea with the Ring-bearers.
-----
Arrival in Middle-earth, c. III 1000: The Wizards arrived in Middle-earth after the end of the first millennium of the Third Age. They were sent by the Valar to aid Elves and Men, but none knew this but C?dan the Shipwright, Lord of the Grey Havens where their ships put in. Though Saruman was at that time the acknowledged leader of the Wizards, C?dan saw that Gandalf was in fact the greater, and secretly gave him the Red Ring Narya to aid him in his quest.
-----
Exploration of Middle-earth, c. III 1000 to III 2463: For almost 1,500 years, Gandalf wandered the northern and western regions of Middle-earth, learning of its lands and cultures. He was closest in friendship with the Elves, and especially Elrond, who had learned of his origins from C?dan.
-----
The White Council, III 2463 to III 2953: At almost the same time as Gandalf had arrived in Middle-earth, a dark power had appeared in southern Mirkwood, at the evil place known as Dol Guldur. After a thousand years of his wanderings, Gandalf went there and drove the darkness into the east for a while. Soon it returned, and in III 2463, the greatest among Wizards and Elves formed a White Council, with Gandalf as a prominent member, to counter the growing threat.
 In 2850, he revisited Dol Guldur, to find that the power that held it had grown indeed during the eight hundred years since his last visit. He recognised the dark power now as Sauron returned, and escaped to inform the White Council. Before he escaped, though, he found Thr?n II broken in the pits of Dol Guldur, and though Thr?n died before Gandalf could help him, he did surrender a map and a key into the Wizard's keeping.
The Year III 2941: 2941 was an important year for Gandalf. Not only did he take part in the White Council's expulsion of the Necromancer from Dol Guldur, but he also arranged for a party of Dwarves, accompanied by Bilbo Baggins, to travel to their ancient home of Erebor and free it from the dragon Smaug.
-----
Gandalf and the Hobbits: The Hobbits first appeared in the records of Men and Elves shortly after the arrival of the Wizards, but of all the Wise, Gandalf was the only one to pay them great heed. After the foundation of the Shire, he would visit periodically and was responsible for '... quiet lads and lasses going off into the Blue for mad adventures' (The Hobbit, Chapter 1, An Unexpected Party). Given this description, we are forced to wonder whether he had a hand in the exploits of Hildifons and Isengar Took, both of whom are recorded as having become involved in adventures of this kind.
 Of all the Hobbit families, Gandalf seems to have been most closely associated with the Tooks; he was a close friend of Gerontius, the Old Took (Frodo Baggins' great-grandfather), and was said to have given him a gift of magical diamond studs, which fastened and unfastened on command. After Gerontius' death in III 2920, he was not seen in the Shire for more than twenty years, until he returned with Thorin and the Dwarves to involve Bilbo Baggins in the Quest of Erebor.
-----
Gandalf's Appearance: Like all the Wizards, Gandalf had the appearance of an old man, who grew old slowly with the passage of the centuries. His hair was white, and his long white beard grew down below his waist. His eyebrows were particularly noticeable; they were so long and bushy that they stuck out from beneath the rim of his hat.
 He dressed in a long grey cloak, which is perhaps the origin of his title 'The Grey'. He is also described as wearing a tall shady-brimmed pointed blue hat, a silver scarf, and long black boots. He carried at all times a spiked staff.
-----
The Magic of Gandalf: Tolkien at no point defines what the limits of Gandalf's magic were. As a Maia, he had many natural abilities that would seem magical to mortal races, but he also had a great store of knowledge of more 'mechanical' magic, worked through spells and incantations, and especially through the agency of his staff. It is clear that he had far greater power, especially after his return as Gandalf the White, than he ever displayed in Middle-earth.
 His magical powers seem to be particularly associated with fire, a fact that is perhaps related to the Ring of Fire, Narya, that he bore.
-----
A Gandalf Miscellany:
- Gandalf adopted the habit of pipe-smoking from the Hobbits. He often used his magical arts while smoking; he could change the colour of his smoke-rings, or send them in any direction he pleased.
- Gandalf's preferred drink was red wine.

* Gladden
River flowing down from the Misty Mountains and joining Anduin at the Gladden Fields; translation of Sindarin S? Ninglor.
-----
River of the Golden Flowers.
 A minor tributary of the River Anduin, called S? Ninglor by the Elves, that rose in the eastern Misty Mountains and flowed westward to meet the Great River at the Gladden Fields.
 Though it was hardly more than a hundred miles long, the Gladden played a great part in the histories of the Third Age of the World. In the middle years of that Age war raged in Eriador to the west of the Misty Mountains. In about the year III 1409 a clan of refugee Hobbits, of the strong and resilient Stoor variety, fled eastward across the Mountains and settled by the banks of the Gladden.
 We know little of these people, but their society was apparently matriarchal, and they shared many of the same ancient habits and superstitions as their more familiar cousins who remained west of the Mountains. We know that they made a living by fishing among the golden flowers of the Gladden River, and so founded a successful settlement that would last for at least another thousand years.
 Some centuries later, another great war occurred, but this time far to the south and east, beyond the forest of Mirkwood. The Stoors knew nothing of this, until refugees from the battles of the south came to settle on the plains to the north of the Gladden. These were noble, fair-haired Men, descendants of the Kings of Rhovanion and ancestors of the Kings of Rohan. They called themselves simply 'horse-people', or ?th?d in their own tongue. These people did not remain by the Gladden for long. Within two centuries, they rode further north to seek new, more open, lands.
 Though the ?th?d rode into the distant north, many Men remained and so did the Stoors. More than a millennium after their arrival, in about the twenty-fifth century of the Third Age, two young friends of that people journeyed east on the river together to the mouths of the Gladden, where it emptied into the marshlands of the Fields. Through a strange accident, one of them, D?gol by name, fell into the water, and discovered a golden Ring sparkling in the mud on the bottom. His friend, Sm?gol, wanted the Ring for himself: he throttled D?gol, and stole back to his people with the golden and magical Ring. Eventually, his grandmother, who ruled his family, cast him out and he left the banks of the Gladden River to wander into the Misty Mountains and into history, and his name became Gollum.
 While Gollum skulked away the centuries under the Mountains of Mist, he outlived all his family and his people. Soon after Gollum's exile, Orcs began to mass in the Mountains nearby, and War of the Dwarves and Orcs brought the armies of the Dwarves to these regions too. Perhaps the Stoors were destroyed by the Orcs, or overrun in the War. Perhaps they were lost in the Fell Winter of III 2911. Whatever happened, we know that no Stoors were left there at the time of the War of the Ring: the Nazg? went there in search of the Ring, and found only ruins.
 But Gollum's wretched life was stretched out by his magic Ring beyond that of all his kind, until at last that Ring was taken from him. He hunted for it all down the Vales of Anduin, and was himself hunted by Aragorn, at Gandalf's request. Aragorn captured him near the borders of Mordor at the beginning of the year III 3018, and toiled northward with his prisoner. We have an account of his travels in the Unfinished Tales.
-----
'... by tracks as westerly as he could find, through the skirts of Fangorn, and so over Limlight, then over Nimrodel and Silverlode through the eaves of L?ien, and then on, avoiding Moria and the Dimrill Dale, over Gladden...'
(The Hunt for the Ring (ii), in Unfinished Tales of N?enor and Middle-earth)
-----
So the last survivor of the Gladden Stoors saw the long-deserted lands of his home once more before the end.


* Gladden Fields

-----

 The marshlands that formed where the Gladden River flowed down out of the Misty Mountains and into the Great River Anduin. This was the site of Isildur's loss of the One Ring in the first years of the Third Age.


* Gl?scrafu|Gl盾mscrafu|Glaemscrafu
'Caves of Radiance', name in Rohan of Aglarond.


* Glamdring
The sword of Turgon and Gandalf.
 Of Glamdring's early history, we know almost nothing. From Elrond's words in 'The Hobbit' ('This, Gandalf, was Glamdring, Foe-hammer that the king of Gondolin once wore'), we can say that it was forged some time in the second to fifth centuries of the First Age (the centuries when Gondolin existed), and that it was borne by Turgon (the only Elf to hold the title 'King of Gondolin'). After Gondolin was built, Turgon was in battle twice: at the Nirnaeth Arnoediad and at the Fall of Gondolin. Glamdring was greatly feared by the Orcs even thousands of years later, so Turgon must have wielded it ferociously on both these occasions.
 After Gondolin's Fall, Glamdring passed out of history or rumour for more than 6,000 years. The fact that it survived the War of Wrath, though, tells us that it must have left Beleriand before the end of the First Age, perhaps carried eastward by a band of Orcs. More than that cannot be said, except that somehow, by the late Third Age, it had fallen into the hands of the three Trolls called in The Hobbit Tom, Bert and Bill Huggins.
 It was discovered in their troll-hoard by Gandalf, Bilbo and the Dwarves as they travelled eastward on the Quest of Erebor, and claimed by Gandalf. After it was identified by Elrond, Gandalf wore if for eighty years. He had it with him when the White Council drove Sauron from Dol Guldur, and he bore it through the War of the Ring itself.
 Famously, he used it to battle the Balrog at the Bridge of Khazad-d?, and it fell with him there into the abyss. Glamdring survived that fall: Gandalf had it with him when he returned, and he bore it throughout the last days of the War of the Ring and beyond. We know that he still had the sword when he rode through Bree with the Travellers in October III 3019, but Tolkien doesn't mention it after that point. It seems safe to assume, though, that Gandalf was still wearing Glamdring, as he had for eighty years, when he boarded the White Ship at the end of the Third Age.


* Glamhoth
Sindarin word for Orcs.
-----
A name for the Orcs.
 Although the Sindarin word for 'Orcs' is 'Yrch', this rare but more descriptive term is also sometimes seen (although not in The Lord of the Rings or The Silmarillion).
 'Glamhoth' does appear, however, in Tuor's curse in the unfinished 'Of Tuor and His Coming to Gondolin'; 'Gurth an Glamhoth' - 'death to the Orcs'. It is also probably seen in a shortened form in the name of Gandalf's sword, Glamdring.


* Glanduin
'Border-river', flowing westwards from the Misty Mountains; forming in the Second Age the southern boundary of Eregion and in the Third a part of the southern boundary of Arnor.
-----
The river that flowed down into Swanfleet.
 The river that rose in the Misty Mountains, south of Khazad-d?. It flowed westward to meet the Hoarwell above Tharbad, where it formed the marshland known as N?-in-Eilph or Swanfleet.


* Glanhir
'Boundary-stream', Sindarin name of the Mering Stream.


* Glaurung
The first of the Dragons of Morgoth, called the Father of Dragons; in the Dagor Bragollach, the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, and the Sack of Nargothrond; cast his spell upon T?in and upon Nienor; slain by T?in at Cabed-en-Aras. Called also the Great Worm and the Worm of Morgoth.
-----
Golden Father of Dragons.
 Glaurung was the first of the Dragons, and one of the greatest. He first issued from Angband in I 265, but not being fully grown at that time, the Noldor under Fingon were able to drive him back.
 In the Dagor Bragollach and the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, Glaurung was in the vanguard of Morgoth's forces, and having grown to his full power, he wreaked great destruction on those battlefields. In the Nirnaeth, he was driven back to Angband by the heavily armoured Dwarves, though their lord Azagh? was slain in that battle.
 Glaurung led the assault by Morgoth on Nargothrond, and there came across T?in for the first time. He dwelt in the ruined halls of Finrod Felagund for a while, but came forth at last to seek T?in. He was slain by T?in's black sword Gurthang in the Forest of Brethil.


* Glingal
'Hanging Flame', the image of Laurelin made by Turgon in Gondolin.
-----
The mate of Belthil in the courts of Turgon.

* Glirhuin
A minstrel of Brethil.


* Glithui
River flowing down from Ered Wethrin, a tributary of Teiglin.


* Glittering Caves
The caverns behind Helm's Deep.
 Also called Aglarond, the spectacular jewelled caverns that lay in the White Mountains behind Helm's Deep. They were discovered by Gimli Elf-friend during the War of the Ring, and were later colonised by the Dwarves of Erebor, with Gimli becoming Lord of the Glittering Caves.
 The Glittering Caves is one of very few locations in Tolkien's work that we can associate with a real place. They were inspired by the caves of Cheddar Gorge, in the southern English county of Somerset.


* Gl?n (King of Durin's Folk)|Gl?n|Gloin
The son of Thorin I, and father of ?n, King of Durin's Folk during the later Third Age.


* Gl?n (Son of Gr?n)|Gl?n|Gloin
Son of Gr?n, and father of Gimli Elf-friend, Gl?n accompanied Gandalf and Bilbo Baggins on the Quest of Erebor, and years later was present with his son at the Council of Elrond.


* Gl?edhel|Gloredhel
Daughter of Hador L?indol of Dor-l?in and sister of Galdor; wedded Haldir of Brethil.
-----
Daughter of Hador L?indol; she wedded Haldir of the Haladin.


* Glorfindel of Gondolin|Glorfindel
Elf of Gondolin who fell to his death in Cirith Thoronath in combat with a Balrog after the escape from the sack of the city. The name means 'Golden-haired'.
-----
Chief of Gondolin's House of the Golden Flower.
 A noble Elf of Gondolin, who fled the Fall of that city with Tuor and Idril and whose battle with a Balrog in the Encircling Mountains secured their escape with their son E?endil.


* Glorfindel of Rivendell|Glorfindel
An heroic Elf-lord of Rivendell.
 A noble Elf of Rivendell, who fought at the Battle of Fornost and, a thousand years later, helped Frodo Baggins and his companions to reach the House of Elrond and evade the pursuit of the Black Riders. The name means 'Golden-haired Elf'.


* Gnats|Gnat
Bothersome flying insects.
 Small flying insects, related to flies. They are known to have existed in Middle-earth, as Sam refers to them on the borders of Mordor.


* Goatleaf Family|Goatleaf
A family of the Men of Bree. As was typical among the Men of that region, the name comes from a plant. Its precise origins are uncertain, but it is perhaps linked to honeysuckle, whose French name, ch?refeuille, not only means 'goat leaf', but gives its name to a medieval lay, and would therefore presumably have been familiar to Tolkien.
 Only one member of the Goatleaf family appears in Tolkien's works - Harry Goatleaf, who at one time watched the West-gate of Bree, but threw in his lot with Bill Ferny and Saruman's thugs during the War of the Ring.


* Goblin-cleaver
A name for the sword Orcrist, and the literal translation of its Elvish name. It was forged in the city of Gondolin during the First Age, when the Elves warred with the Orcs of Morgoth, and Orcrist was said to have killed hundreds of Goblins in those Wars.


* Goblin-men|Goblin-man
Creatures bred by Saruman as his servants.
 Creatures created by Saruman, apparently by blending the races of Orcs and Men. Precisely what they were is mysterious - they are only ever mentioned once by name, during the Battle of the Hornburg - but they seem to be distinct from Half-orcs, and rather more Man-like.


* Goblins|Goblin
The race of Orcs.
 A name for Orcs, and especially the smaller kinds that infested the Misty and the Grey Mountains in the later Third Age, and had their capital at Mount Gundabad.


* Gods|God
A name wrongly given by Men to the Valar. While Tolkien states that Men have 'often' called the Valar gods, in fact the term is very rare in his books; it is most prominently used at the debate of Estolad, where the Men newly arrived in Beleriand dispute whether or not to remain. This is natural, of course; they had not at this point been tutored by the Elves in such high matters.
 It is tempting to suppose that 'Men have often called them gods' refers to the years after the end of the Third Age, and might even suggest equivalences between the Valar and mythological gods of later times, such as those of the Greeks or Vikings. This cannot be correct, however; the Valaquenta represents a very ancient text within the context of The Silmarillion, probably dating from the mid to late First Age, and therefore can only refer to the Men of those times.


* Golasgil
The lord of the Anfalas or Langstrand, a pastoral fief on the far western shores of Gondor. He rode to the defence of Minas Tirith in the War of the Ring with some few of his household and Men of the Anfalas.


* Goldberry
The companion of Tom Bombadil.
-----
"O slender as a willow-wand! O clearer than clear water!
O reed by the living pool! Fair River-daughter!"
(From Frodo's greeting to Goldberry; The Fellowship of the Ring I 7, In the House of Tom Bombadil)
-----
A mysterious being described as the 'River-daughter', the companion of Tom Bombadil.


* Golden Hall
The gold-thatched hall of the Kings of Rohan.
 A common name for Meduseld, the hall of the Kings of Rohan in Edoras.


* Golden Wood
The forest of the golden mallorn trees.
 A name used of L?ien, and with a similar meaning, referring to the golden mallorn trees that grew in that land.


* Goldenbed|Golden-bed|Golden Bed
The later name of the River Ascar.
 To the north of Ossiriand, the Dwarf-road into the Blue Mountains ran alongside the River Ascar. This road was used in the later years of the First Age by a band of Dwarves returning to Nogrod with the looted treasures of Doriath. Waylayed by Beren and a force of Green-elves, they were defeated, and the treasure was scattered along the bed of the Ascar. After that time, the river was renamed Rathl?iel, which translates as 'Goldenbed'.


* Goldfather
A surname of the Master of Buckland Rorimac Brandybuck, who was also known as 'Old Rory'.


* Goldilocks Gardner
A daughter of Samwise Gamgee and Rose Cotton, so named because her fair hair was rare among the Shire-hobbits. She married Thain Faramir I, son of Peregrin Took.


* Goldwine
Sixth of the Kings of Rohan.
 Goldwine, the sixth Lord of the Mark, inherited the throne from his father Fr?wine. Of his life and reign almost nothing is known, apart from a general note that Rohan had peace and prosperity during his nineteen years as King. Goldwine was the last of Rohan's Kings to enjoy a peaceful reign for many years. He was succeeded by his son D?r, in whose time the Dunlendings driven out by Goldwine's great-grandfather Aldor began to reappear in the northern marches. They would trouble the Rohirrim for many generations.


* Golfimbul
The orc-chieftain who invaded the Shire.
 An orc-chieftain of Mount Gram, who led a band of his Orcs in an invasion of the Shire. He was met, and defeated, at the Battle of Greenfields by Bandobras 'Bullroarer' Took. According to (no doubt apocryphal) legend, the events of that battle, coupled with Golfimbul's name, gave rise to the game of golf.


* Gollum
Wretched slave to the One Ring.
 Originally a creature of hobbit-kind, who came by the One Ring in the River Anduin, where Isildur had lost it more than two millennia before. Coming under its power, he hid away in the Misty Mountains, and was drawn into the events at the end of the Third Age when he encountered Bilbo Baggins, who took the Ring from him.


* Golodhrim
The Noldor. Golodh was the Sindarin form of Quenya Noldo, and -rim a collective plural ending. See Annon-in-Gelydh, the Gate of the Noldor.
-----
A Sindarin name for the Deep Elves.
 The name of the Noldor among the Sindar; rarely used in Tolkien's work, but probably the dominant form in Beleriand.


* Golug
Orc name for the Noldor.
-----
An Orkish name for the Noldor.
 A word from a language of the Orcs, whose only recorded use was during the later First Age, used to describe the Deep Elves or Noldor. Its origins are unknown, but it may be related to the Sindarin name for this same people, Golodhrim.


* Gondolin|Hidden Realm
'The Hidden Rock' (see Ondolind?, secret city of King Turgon surrounded by the Encircling Mountains (Echoriath); destroyed by Morgoth.
-----
Turgon's Hidden Refuge.
 The great Hidden City of Turgon was concealed from friend and foe alike during the First Age by the Encircling Mountains, and guarded from trespassers by the Eagles of Thorondor.
 In the fiftieth year of the First Age, Turgon journeyed from his halls in Nevrast with his cousin Finrod. Ulmo guided him to the hidden valley of Tumladen, and there he founded Gondolin. The city was completed in c. I 126, and Turgon's people who had dwelt in Nevrast travelled there secretly.
 The city was inviolate for almost four hundred years; Turgon did not break his secret leaguer until the time of the Nirnaeth Arnoediad in I 471, and even after that disastrous battle he was able to return in secret to the city with the aid of H?in Thalion.
 Morgoth's servants finally discovered Gondolin through the treachery of Maeglin, and it was sacked in I 510. Turgon was lost in the Fall of the city, but some few (including Tuor and Idril, with their child E?endil) escaped the destruction and dwelt as Exiles at the Mouths of Sirion.
-----
The Building of Gondolin: The round valley of Tumladen, within the Encircling Mountains, had originally been a lake, and in its centre stood a hill that had once been an island: Amon Gwareth. It was here that Turgon decided to found his Hidden City, as a memorial to ancient Tirion that lay beyond the Great Sea.
 The first building of the city took fifty-two years to complete. After this time, the people of Turgon, a great number of Noldor and Sindar, travelled from Nevrast, where they had dwelt, and secretly entered the valley of Tumladen. Turgon gave his city the name Ondolind?(Quenya for 'The Rock of the Music of Water', because of the fountains of Amon Gwareth), but in Sindarin this was rendered Gondolin, the Hidden Rock.
 After their arrival in the new city, the Gondolindrim continued to labour in its building, until it was said to rival even Tirion itself. Its walls stood high and white above the plain, and its most prominent feature was the great Tower of the King, where, among the fountains, Turgon himself made Glingal and Belthil, trees of gold and silver made in memory of the Two Trees of Valinor.
-----
The Coming of Maeglin: There followed two centuries of happy peace: Morgoth was besieged in the far north of the world, and the people of Gondolin lived undisturbed by the events outside their fair city. At last, though, a seed of discontent appeared: King Turgon's sister Aredhel determined to leave the city, much against Turgon's wishes, and journey into Middle-earth.
 Soon after her departure, her guards returned, and reported that they had lost her in the dark and sorcerous region to the south east of the city, known as Nan Dungortheb.
 More than twenty years then passed, and then suddenly Aredhel returned. With her was one who she claimed to be Maeglin, her son by E? the Dark Elf of Nan Elmoth. This Maeglin accepted Turgon as lord, but his father E? had followed his wife and son to Gondolin and been captured at the entranceway. He was brought before Turgon. E? refused to submit to Turgon's authority, and instead chose death for himself and his unwilling son. He threw a poisoned dart to slay Maeglin, but instead struck Aredhel, who fell ill with the poison and died. The body of E? was broken on the Caragd? for this.
 Maeglin, though, had had no part in these evils, and Turgon accepted him, and he grew to be among the great in Gondolin, wise in council, cunning in smithcraft and mighty in battle.
-----
Two Great Battles: For more than a hundred years after the deaths of Aredhel and E?, Gondolin again had peace. The time was coming, though, when Morgoth would break the Siege of Angband, and the unstoppable doom of the Elves would fall upon them. One winter's night, the fires of Angband destroyed the leaguer of the Noldor: the Dagor Bragollach. In this disaster, the people of Gondolin played no immediate part.
 They were drawn into the events of those years, though, when two young brothers of the race of Men, H?in and Huor, were cut off from their army and became lost amid the feet of the Crissaegrim. Thorondor brought them to Turgon. At the bidding of Ulmo, Turgon accepted them, and they remained in Gondolin for almost a year, when they returned to their homes. In this kindly act were the first seeds of Gondolin's destruction, more than fifty years later.
 Turgon now devised a new policy for the salvation of the Elves: he began secretly to send his people out westward across the great sea, to seek the land of the Valar and ask their pardon and aid. None of his mariners succeeded, but this was a wise course, though Turgon never knew it: he was lost long before his grandson E?endil, aided by a Silmaril, finally succeeded in this task.
 As time passed since the destruction of the Dagor Bragollach, the Elves of Beleriand began to arm for a counterstroke, and Turgon secretly began his own preparations. Fourteen years after the breaking of the Siege of Angband, and some three hundred and fifty since the completion of Gondolin, Turgon rode for the first time to war. Unknown and unbidden by his kin, he rode to their aid with an army of ten thousand. This was to be the great battle that was to become known as the Nirnaeth Arnoediad.


* Gondolindrim|Hidden People
The people of Gondolin, who went with Turgon to dwell there in the early First Age, and remained hidden from Morgoth until the Fall of the city in I 510.


* Gondor
'Land of Stone', name of the southern N?en?ean kingdom in Middle-earth, established by Isildur and An?ion.
-----
The South-kingdom of the D?edain.
 The second of the two great nations of Men founded in Middle-earth by Elendil after the Downfall of N?enor, the other being Arnor in the north. Gondor was at first ruled jointly by Elendil's sons Isildur and An?ion. Both Elendil and An?ion were lost in the Siege of Barad-d?, and his brother Isildur soon afterwards in the Disaster of the Gladden Fields, and so the Kingship of Gondor fell on An?ion's son Meneldil. Thus, the Kings of Gondor were descendants of An?ion through many generations until the time of E?nur.
 When E?nur was lost in Minas Morgul in III 2050, the rule of Gondor was taken up by the King's Steward, Mardil Voronw? the death of E?nur was not certain, and so Mardil and the Stewards who followed him pledged to rule 'until the King comes back'. Unlikely though this seemed, it happened almost a thousand years later in III 3019 when Aragorn II Elessar, descendant by right line of Isildur, elder brother of An?ion, reclaimed the throne of Gondor.


* Gondorians|Gondorian
The Men of Gondor.
 The people of Gondor, the South-kingdom of the D?edain, whose rulers were descended from the N?en?ean exiles who fled to Middle-earth with Elendil in the late Second Age.


* Gonnhirrim
'Masters of Stone', a Sindarin name for the Dwarves.


* Gorbadoc 'Broadbelt' Brandybuck|Gorbadoc Brandybuck
The generous host of Brandy Hall.
 The son of Marmadoc Brandybuck, who inherited the title Master of Buckland from his father. He was renowned for his love of good food (hence, no doubt, his nickname 'Broadbelt'), and his generous hospitality. It was during one of his famous feasts that Frodo's parents Drogo and Primula were lost in a boating accident.


* Gorbag
An Uruk of Minas Morgul, slain by Shagrat in the Tower of Cirith Ungol in a dispute during the last stages of the War of the Ring.


* Gorhendad Oldbuck|Gorhendad Brandybuck
The founder of Buckland and of the Brandybuck family (when he crossed the River Brandywine from the Shire, he changed his name from Oldbuck).


* Gorlim the Unhappy|Gorlim
Called the Unhappy; one of the twelve companions of Barahir on Dorthonion, who was ensnared by a phantom of his wife Eilinel and revealed to Sauron the hiding-place of Barahir.
-----
The betrayer of Barahir.
 A follower of Barahir, who went into hiding with his lord after the Dagor Bragollach. Captured by Sauron, he was tricked into betraying Barahir, who was slain with all of his followers except Beren.


* Gorthaur
An old name of Sauron.
 A name used of Sauron by the Sindar during the First Age, meaning 'terrible dread'.


* Gorthol
'Dread Helm', the name that T?in took as one of the Two Captains in the land of Dor-C?rthol.
-----
'The Dread Helm', one of T?in's many aliases, taken by him as a captain of Dor-C?rthol in reference to the Dragon-helm of Dor-l?in.


* Gothmog (Lord of Balrogs)|Gothmog
High-captain of Angband, slayer of F?nor, Fingon, and Ecthelion.
-----
The most powerful of all the Balrogs, one of the chief servants of Melkor, who held an authority hardly less than Sauron himself. A wily commander and fearsome fighter, Gothmog was often accompanied by others of his fiery kind, and at least in the Nirnaeth he had a personal guard of dozens of Trolls. His weapon was a great black axe.
 The Elves first encountered him in the Dagor-nuin-Giliath, the battle fought under the stars before the first rising of the Moon. In that battle, F?nor's fury had caused him to draw forward of the main force of the Noldor, and so he came upon Gothmog with only a small guard. Even so, he fought valiantly, and though the armies of the Noldor eventually drove the Balrogs off, F?nor's wounds could not be healed.
 After that first battle, Gothmog does not appear for several centuries. He emerged from Angband to fight in the battle known as the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, the fifth and last battle of the Wars of Beleriand. He brought up a huge army, and drove aside the forces around High King Fingon, and slew the King with his axe. His Trolls assailed Fingon's ally H?in, who he eventually captured and brought back to Angband.
 But Gothmog was not indestructible. He took part in (and indeed presumably led) Morgoth's deadly surprise assault on the Hidden City of Gondolin. In the square of the King in the heart of the city, he came upon the Elf-lord Ecthelion of the Fountain. They fought a great duel, and in the end Gothmog and Ecthelion slew one another. So ended one of the most feared denizens of the pits of Angband.


* Gothmog (Lieutenant of Morgul)|Gothmog
Lieutenant of Morgul at the Battle of the Pelennor.
 Lieutenant of the Lord of the Nazg? at the Battle of the Pelennor - he took command of the forces of Minas Morgul after the loss of his lord.


* Gram
The eighth King of Rohan.
 The son of D?r and father of Helm Hammerhand, who ruled Rohan as the eighth Lord of the Mark. His reign was a time of warfare with the Dunlendings, who had occupied Isengard during his father's time, and continued to raid and harrass the Rohirrim.


* Great Battle
The ultimate destruction of Angband.
 A name for the War of Wrath, the assault of the Valar on Morgoth's stronghold of Angband at the end of the First Age.


* Great Gate of Gondolin
Maeglin's Gate of Steel.
 The Seventh Gate said to have been added to the existing six gates of Gondolin by Maeglin, after Morgoth's victory in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad. According to legend, the gate was made of steel and seven storeys high, but inconsistencies between accounts mean that its existence cannot be considered certain.


* Great Gate of Minas Tirith
Entrance to the City of Gondor.
 The mighty gate of Minas Tirith, citadel of Gondor, leading from the lowest of its seven tiers out onto the Pelennor Fields.


* Great Gates
The eastern entrance to Khazad-d?.
 Another name for the East-gate of Moria, the greater of the two entrances to that realm, and the Gates through which the Company of the Ring escaped during their journey southward.


* Great Goblin
The ruler of Goblin-town.
 The chief of the goblins who dwelt in Goblin-town by the High Pass in the Misty Mountains; he was never named by Tolkien, and was killed by Gandalf during the Quest of Erebor.


* Great Gulf
A wide gulf of Belegaer.
 A wide gulf in the western coasts of Middle-earth. It lay far to the south of the known lands in Middle-earth's northwestern parts, forming an important feature in the geography of Arda. It was also one of the world's most ancient features - the Gulf was already in existence when Melkor overthrew the Lamps of the Valar, in the time when the Valar still dwelt in the Hither Lands.


* Great Hall of Feasts
The feasting-hall of Minas Tirith.
 The King's feasting-hall in Minas Tirith, where Aragorn greeted ?mer after the War of the Ring. It was more properly known by its Elvish name, Merethrond.


* Great House
The hall of the Master of Lake-town, in which Thorin and Company were welcomed by the people of Lake-town, but which was later destroyed by Smaug when he descended on that township.

* Great Journey
The journey of the Eldar into the West.
 The journey of the Eldar from Cuivi?en across Middle-earth and the Great Sea to Aman, there to dwell with the Valar in Valinor. Many of the Teleri turned aside during the journey, but the Three Kindreds of the Vanyar, the Noldor and the remaining Teleri came at last to the Undying Lands.


* Great Lake
The lake that held the island of Almaren.
 The lake in the central regions of Middle-earth, known for holding the island of Almaren, the first dwelling place of the Valar.

-----
"Great Orcs... that kind is stronger and more fell than all others."
(?mer, from The Two Towers III 2, The Riders of Rohan)
-----
Common name for the large soldier-orcs of Mordor and later also Isengard that troubled Gondor and Rohan in the late Third Age.
 In fact, this name is only ever used by ?mer, and may only have been current in Rohan, but the fearsome creatures it described had been known for five hundred years when he spoke these words: creatures whose name in their own Black Speech was Uruk-hai.


* Great Plague
The plague that spread out of Rhovanion into Gondor and Eriador in Third Age 1636.
-----
The sickness of the middle years of the Third Age.
 Another name for the Dark Plague, the sickness that blighted Middle-earth in the middle of the Third Age. Gondor, in particular, was devastated: the then King, Telemnar, was lost with all his children.


* Great Ring
Greatest of the Rings of Power.
 A title occasionally used to refer to Sauron's One Ring.


* Great Rings
The Rings of Power.
 The nineteen powerful Rings forged in Eregion in the Second Age, mostly with the aid of Sauron, of which nine were given by him to Men, and seven to the Dwarves; three the Elves retained. The One Ring is also counted among the Great, but that was forged by Sauron alone in Orodruin.
 Although the Elven-smiths of Eregion forged many rings in the mid-Second Age, only these nineteen are concerned Great. The nature and abilities of each of the Great Rings differed, but each shared two powers.
 The first of these was the prolongation or 'stretching' of life - the bearer of a Great Ring did not age. This effect only applied to mortal bearers of the Rings; the Elves and Wizards were already 'immortal' by nature, and this power did not seem to affect them. This explains the peculiar longevity of Bilbo Baggins and especially Gollum (a creature of hobbit-kind, Gollum should have lived no more than 100 years or so, and yet under the influence of the One Ring, he survived for more than 500 years beneath the Misty Mountains).
 The second power conferred by the Great Rings was that of invisibility. At first, this was a temporary effect, and only occurred when the bearer actually wore the ring. After a time, though, this invisibility would become permanent (hence the nine Ring-wraiths, though their Rings were held by Sauron, were always invisible). This invisibility seems to have been due to the wearer being transported to the 'wraith-world', a strange 'dimension' that co-exists with the real world.
 Tolkien's various references to the Great Rings seem to make it clear that they all had the power of invisibility. However, the Three Rings of the Elves seemed to be exempt from this - although the Rings were normally invisible themselves, their bearers did not vanish (this is perhaps due to Sauron's having no part in their making).
 The Seven Rings of the Dwarves, which were among the Great Rings, raise a question. We know that one of these Rings was held by the Kings of Durin's Folk, and yet through all the hundreds of years they bore it, there is no record of this Ring displaying any of its powers. Though the Dwarf-kings no doubt kept it secret and used it little, there are strong hints here that the Dwarves somehow had a greater immunity to the effects of the Great Rings than other mortal kinds.


* Great River
The River Anduin.
 Very common title given to the River Anduin, the greatest river in Middle-earth, which flowed for many hundred miles from the far north down into the Bay of Belfalas.


* Great Sea of the West|Great Sea
The immense ocean to the west of Middle-earth.
 Belegaer, the mighty ocean that lay off the western coasts of Middle-earth. Far across the sea to the west lay Aman, the Undying Lands, and in the midst of this ocean was set N?enor during the Second Age.


* Great Siege
One of two long sieges in the history of Middle-earth.
 A term of uncertain meaning, referring to either the Siege of Angband or the Siege of Barad-d?.


* Great Smials
The seat of the Took family.
 The ancestral home of the Took family, located at Tuckborough in the Westfarthing of the Shire.


* Great Worm
Glaurung, Father of Dragons.
 A title of Glaurung, the first and one of the greatest of the Worms ('worm' is a name for those creatures more commonly called dragons).


* Greater Gelion
One of the two tributary branches of the river Gelion in the north, rising in Mount Rerir.
-----
The greater of Gelion's two source-rivers.
 One of the two rivers that flowed together to form the source of long Gelion, that flowed along the eastern borders of Beleriand. The Greater Gelion rose beneath Mount Rerir in the northern Blue Mountains, and flowed southwestwards to meet the Little Gelion. It formed the eastern boundary of the lands controlled by Maglor during most of the First Age.


* Green-elves|Green-elf
Translation of Laiquendi; the Nandorin Elves of Ossiriand.
-----
The Laiquendi of Ossiriand.
 Lenw?was an Elf of the Telerin clan, who set out with the Great Journey of the Elves into the West. When his people found their path blocked by the Misty Mountains, he resolved to leave the Journey and instead led his followers south down the Vales of Anduin, and they became known as the Nandor. After many years, Lenw?s son Denethor set out westward once again, and led some part of the Nandor across the Misty Mountains and the Blue, settling at last in the Land of Seven Rivers beneath the Ered Luin; the land called Ossiriand.
 Denethor and his followers did not have peace for long. Soon after his return to Middle-earth, before the Noldor had followed him, Morgoth loosed armies of Orcs on King Thingol and his allies, C?dan in the west and Denethor in the east. Denethor's Nandor were ill-equipped for warfare, and suffered great hardship in that battle. Denethor himself was slain on Amon Ereb, though the Elves beat back the Orcs at last. After that time many of Denethor's people left Ossiriand for the guarded forests of Doriath. Those few that remained took up a secretive existence, camouflaging themselves in green. From that time, they were known as the Green-elves, or Laiquendi in the Elvish tongue.
 The hidden people of the Green-elves played little part in history after the First Battle of the Wars of Beleriand. Most significantly, they lent their aid to Beren and Dior (who dwelt on Tol Galen in the far south of their land). After the loss of their ancient ally Thingol at the hands of the Dwarves, they went with Beren to avenge him. Much later, after the deaths of Beren and L?hien, one of their lords took up the Silmaril that L?hien had borne, and brought it to Menegroth where Dior now dwelt.
 After the end of the First Age, their fate is not clearly known. Much of their land survived the destruction of Beleriand, and as Lindon came under the rule of Gil-galad. Some at least seem to have removed to Eriador, as a note in the Unfinished Tales mentions Green-elves living on the shores of Lake Nenuial during the Second Age. After this, nothing is known of their fate.

 From their beginnings in the Westfarthing, the Hills cut through the northern corner of the Southfarthing, where the village of Pincup lay on their southern slopes. Finally, they passed through the border into the Eastfarthing, where they became densely wooded, and reached their eastern end at the appropriately named Woody End.

 At least three rivers and streams had their sources among the Green Hills; the River Shirebourn, Thistle Brook and the Stock-brook. One of the chief towns of the Shire-hobbits, Tuckborough, lay among the western hills, and other villages were to be found among their slopes, or about their feet, including Tookbank, Woodhall and Pincup.

In his turn, Gr?n was father to ?n and Gl?n, and uncle to Balin and Dwalin, all four of whom travelled on the Quest of Erebor.
 Through his son Gl?n, he was also grandfather to Gimli Elf-friend of the Company of the Ring. For all his genealogical importance, though, we know almost nothing of his life. His dates of birth and death, though, show us that he was alive at the time of Smaug's Sack of Erebor, and the Battle of Nanduhirion twenty-nine years later. It is more than likely that he was present at both these events.

 Gr? was born into the House of Durin during its last troubled years in the Grey Mountains. He was the youngest of the three sons of King D?n I, who ruled Durin's Folk during their wars with the dragons of the north. When Gr? was just twenty-six years old, a cold-drake attacked D?n's halls, and slew the King along with his second son, Fr?.
 The two remaining brothers resolved to flee the Grey Mountains with their people and settle elsewhere. As the elder brother, Thr? inherited the Kingship, and led his people back to Erebor in the east. Young Gr? travelled still farther east, to the Iron Hills, where he founded a realm of his own.
 Gr? saw many mishaps and tragedies during his reign. The kingdom of his brother Thr? was destroyed by the dragon Smaug, and Gr?'s son and heir, N?n, was killed at the Battle of Nanduhirion before he could inherit. Gr?'s rule passed instead to his grandson D?n Ironfoot. Many years later, at the Battle of Five Armies, Thr?'s last descendant, Thorin Oakenshield, was lost. D?n inherited the high Kingship of Durin's Folk, a title that remained with the descendants of Gr?.

 Until that time, the Haladin had no single leader, but with the assault of the Orcs Haldad took on the role. He gathered what remnant he could of his people, and built a defensive stockade between the rivers Gelion and Ascar, south of Sarn Athrad. There the Orcs besieged them until their food was exhausted. Haldad led a sortie against the attacking Orcs, and was slain; his son Haldar rushed to recover his father's body, and was slain in turn.

* High King
King of all the D?edain.
 A title used by the D?edain for their ultimate ruler. Normally, 'High King' would refer to a king who ruled over other lesser kings and lords, but this is not necessarily the case with the High King of the D?edain. The term seems to date back to the early days of N?enor, where Tar-Meneldur the fifth King was addressed as 'High King', though he had no other rulers in his service.
 The more common use of the title, though, came at the end of the Second Age, with the establishment of the Realms in Exile in Middle-earth. In their earliest years, the Two Kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor fell under the ultimate rule of one man, Elendil, who dwelt in Arnor as the High King. The South-kingdom of Gondor was ruled jointly by his sons, but only under his suzerainty.
 With Elendil's loss in the Siege of Barad-d?, his elder son Isildur inherited the High Kingship. Isildur ruled for only two years, though, before he too was lost in the Disaster of the Gladden Fields. After his death, historical events conspired to separate the Two Kingdoms, each of which took Kings of their own. The High Kingship should in principle have fallen on Isildur's heir Valandil, but in practice Valandil became King of Arnor only, and had no power over the South-kingdom.
 More than three thousand years were to pass before Aragorn reunited Elendil's realms. In doing so, as the direct descendant of Isildur through many generations, he also resurrected the High Kingship.


* High King of Arda
A title given to Manw?S?imo, greatest of the Valar, and accounted lord of the realm of Arda.


* High King of the Elves
Noblest of all the Elder Kindred.
 The title of Ingw?of the Vanyar, who dwelt on Taniquentil beneath Manw?s halls, and was considered the most noble of the Elves.


* High King of the Noldor
A title of six lords of the Deep Elves.
 The title of six Elf-lords of the Noldor. They held titular rulership over all the Noldor of Middle-earth, though in practice circumstances prevented the effective use of this power until the time of the Last Alliance. The Sons of F?nor, in particular, while they acknowledged the Kingship, paid its bearer little heed; they preferred to follow their own policies under the general leadership of Maedhros.
-----
1- Finw?(ruled c.9,000 years before the beginning of the First Age): The first lord of the Noldor awoke at Cuivi?en and led his people into the West to dwell in Valinor. He was slain by Morgoth at Formenos, and succeeded by his eldest son.
2- F?nor (ruled briefly during the First Age): He led the host of the Noldor back to Middle-earth to avenge his father's death and recover the Silmarils from Morgoth. He was slain in his assault on Angband. After his death, the Kingship by right belonged to his eldest son Maedhros, but he refused it and the succession passed instead to F?nor's half-brother.
3- Fingolfin (ruled 454 years to I 455): He dwelt to the northwest of Beleriand with his sons, and ruled the Noldor during the Siege of Angband. When Morgoth broke the leaguer in the Dagor Bragollach, he rode in anger to the gates of Angband and died in single combat with Morgoth. He was succeeded by his eldest son.
4- Fingon (ruled 16 years to I 471): His short reign was one of endless war with the forces of Morgoth. With Maedhros, he prepared a final assault on Morgoth, the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, which ended in disaster for the Noldor and Fingon's own death. He was succeeded by his brother.
5- Turgon (ruled 39 years to I 510): Turgon's kingship was titular indeed, for even his own kin did not know the location of his Hidden City of Gondolin. Gondolin's location was discovered by Morgoth through the treachery of Maeglin, and Turgon died in its Fall. After his death, the Kingship passed back to Fingon's line, to his only son.
6- Ereinion Gil-galad (ruled 3,514 years to II 3441): The last High King, Gil-galad held the Kingship longer than any of his forebears since Finw? He formed the Last Alliance with Elendil, and died during the Siege of Barad-d? at the end of the Second Age.
-----
Gil-galad was the last High King; after his time the title is never used. In order of succession, the Kingship would presumably have fallen on Turgon's descendants; E?endil (who was in the West and could not exercise it) or his eldest son Elrond (who never made claim to the Kingship).

* Hildifons Took

-----

* Hildigrim Took
Ancestor of both Peregrin Took and Meriadoc Brandybuck.
 The fourth child of Gerontius, the Old Took, who married Rosa Baggins and was thus very distantly related to both Bilbo and Frodo. Among his great-grandchildren were both Peregrin Took (the son of Hildigrim's grandson Paladin) and Meriadoc Brandybuck (the son of his granddaughter Esmeralda). Hildigrim never became Thain himself, but the Thainship did eventually pass to his descendants, so that Paladin II and his line held that distinction.

* Hild?ien|Hildorien

From that high place they could survey the South-kingdom and the lands that bordered it.


* Hill of Spies
The guard-hill of Nargothrond.
 Amon Ethir, the artificial hill raised by Finrod Felagund eastward of his stronghold of Nargothrond, as a watch on the wide Guarded Plain of Talath Dirnen.

 A small island that lay off the northwestern coasts of Middle-earth, about twenty-five miles out from the shores of northern Lindon. During the First Age, this had not been an island but a hill - Himring, where Maedhros' fortress had stood. When the western lands were flooded at the end of the First Age, the plains about the hill were drowned, and it was left standing as an island.


* Himring
The great hill west of Maglor's Gap on which was the stronghold of Maedhros; translated as 'Ever-cold'.
-----
The hill where Maedhros' fortress stood.
 A hill in the northeast of Beleriand, on which was the fortress of Maedhros, eldest of the Sons of F?nor. After the drowning of Beleriand at the end of the First Age, the peak of Himring remained above the waves.


* Hirgon
The bearer of the Red Arrow.
 An emissary of Gondor, who brought the Red Arrow to Th?den at Harrowdale, in token of Gondor's desperate need for help from its old allies.

* Hither Shore
A poetic name for Middle-earth.
 In general use, 'Hither Shore' was a term used especially by the Elves for the mortal lands of Middle-earth, a reminder of the far distant shores of Aman. In First Age Sindarin, it also had a more specific meaning, since it translates into that language as the name Nevrast, a cold seaward region in the northwest of Beleriand.

* Hob Gammidge
The Roper of Tighfield.
 The son of Wiseman Gamwich, who must have travelled with his father when the family relocated from their original home, the village of Gamwich itself, to take up a life in Tighfield. Hob made his living in Tighfield as a roper, and so was the founder of long family tradition. He had a son, Hobson, through whom he became the grandfather of Hamfast Gamgee, and the great-grandfather of Sam Gamgee of the Fellowship of the Ring.
 In his older years, Hob acquired the nickname 'Old Gammidgy', a play on his own name 'Gammidge' which was itself a corruption of the village name Gamwich. This playful name itself became transformed into the better known 'Gamgee', and was the origin of Hamfast's and Samwise's family name.


* Hobbit-holes|Hobbit-hole
The underground dwellings of the Little Folk.
 Originally the Hobbits' preferred style of dwelling, holes buried into hillsides, downs and banks. By the late Third Age, these had largely been replaced by buildings of wood or brick, but hobbit-holes were still in use by the more established Hobbit families of the Shire (for example, at Bag End and Great Smials).


* Hobbiton
Village in the Westfarthing of the Shire, home of Bilbo Baggins.
-----
The township beneath the Hill.
 Large town in the central regions of the Shire, within the borders of the Westfarthing. The town was overlooked by Hobbiton Hill (usually called simply 'The Hill'), in which was Bag End, the ancestral smial of the Baggins family.

 Usually called simply 'The Hill', it stood to the north of the town of Hobbiton. Bag End was tunnelled into this hill by Bungo Baggins.


* Hobbits|Hobbit
The Little People.
 A mortal race almost certainly related to Men, though their origins are unknown. Their most distinguishing feature was their short stature; even the tallest Hobbits rarely exceeded four feet in height.
 Originally a widespread people, Hobbits were found in much of the north of Middle-earth and down the Vales of Anduin. As the Third Age passed, the Hobbits moved north and west, eventually founding the land of the Shire in III 1601.
 See also Halflings, Perian, Shire-folk.


* Hobbits of Bree

 The Hobbits who lived in the Shire, the land between the White Downs and the River Brandywine. They are more often referred to as the Shire-hobbits or, especially, the Shire-folk.


* Hobgoblins
Greater Goblins.
 A name for the larger kinds of Orc found in Middle-earth in the Third Age. The term perhaps, but doubtfully, refers to the large soldier-orcs known as Uruks.
 The term appears so rarely that there is little clear basis for a definition. Its only other occurrence is later in The Hobbit (7, Queer Lodgings) where Gandalf warns Bilbo that the Grey Mountains are 'simply stiff with goblins, hobgoblins, and Orcs of the worst description'.


* Hobson
Sam Gamgee's rope-making grandfather.
 The son of Hob Gammidge, who was in turn the father of Hamfast 'Gaffer' Gamgee, and the grandfather of Samwise Gamgee, who found fame on the Quest of Mount Doom. Hobson, who was the first member of the family to adopt the name 'Gamgee', was the unnamed 'grand-dad' of Sam's who held a rope-walk in Tighfield in the Shire.


* Holbytlan
The ancient origin of the word 'Hobbit'.
 An old word from the language of the Northmen (the ancestral speech of the Rohirrim), said to mean 'hole-builders'. 'Holbytlan' is the ultimate source of the name 'Hobbit'.


* Holdwine
The name of Merry Brandybuck in Rohan.
 The name given to Meriadoc Brandybuck among the Rohirrim, and used by them to record his deeds in their annals. Its meaning is never given explicitly, but it seems to be something close to 'lover of burrows' (that is, a term with a similar meaning to 'hobbit').


* Hollin
The lost land of Eregion.
 The name among Men for the land of Elves known as Eregion, that thrived in the lands west of Khazad-d? during the early part of the Second Age. The name comes from the great holly trees that grew there.


* Hollowbold
Translation of Nogrod: 'hollow dwelling' (early English bold, noun related to the verb build).


* Holly
A thorny evergreen species of ilex. In Middle-earth, it was especially abundant in the land of Eregion or Hollin, which took its name from this tree.


* Holman 'Long Horn' Cotton|Holman Cotton
The first Hobbit to use the surname 'Cotton'.
 An early member of the Cotton family, and in fact the first to use 'Cotton' as a surname. He came from Bywater near Hobbiton, and presumably farmed the same land, down South Lane, as his son Tolman years later. Holman's cousin was his namesake, Holman Greenhand the gardener, whose gardening tradition would eventually passed on to Hamfast Gamgee and his son, Sam.


* Holman Greenhand
Hobbit of the Shire, Bilbo Baggins' gardener.
-----
One of a long line of Hobbiton gardeners.
 The Greenhands were descended from Holman the greenhanded, and Holman's namesake and grandson, Holman Greenhand, was at least the third of the line to tend the gardens of Hobbiton. Holman was the gardener at Bag End for Bilbo Baggins, and perhaps also for his father Bungo. In about the year III 2941, he took on his young relation Hamfast Gamgee as an apprentice. Hamfast eventually became the gardener at Bag End himself, and was followed by his son Samwise.
 In a curious and unlikely way, Holman was instrumental in the winning of the War of the Ring. One morning in the spring of III 2941, Bag End was visited by the Wizard Gandalf. Bilbo was away from home for the Elves' New Year, so Gandalf struck up a conversation with Holman. It was Holman's description of his employer that encouraged Gandalf to include Bilbo in the journey to the Lonely Mountain, which in turn led to the finding of the One Ring, the means through which Sauron was ultimately defeated. If not for the part of Holman Greenhand, then, the western lands might well have fallen under the yoke of the Dark Lord.


* Holman the Greenhanded
A distant ancestor of Sam Gamgee.
 Sam Gamgee's ancestor, who seems to have founded the tradition of gardening in Hobbiton that was carried on by his great-grandson Hamfast Gamgee and Hamfast's own son, Sam himself. Holman founded a family of gardeners who took their surname from his nickname: the Greenhands. It was through Holman's grandson and namesake Holman Greenhand that Hamfast came to Hobbiton from Tighfield, and turned his hand to the family tradition of gardening.


* Holy Mountain (in N?enor)|Holy Mountain
The Pillar of Heaven.
 A name for the Meneltarma, the tall mountain that stood in the centre of the isle of N?enor that was called the Pillar of Heaven by the N?en?eans. From its summit, they gave thanks to Eru three times each year.

 A term for the Ainur, the primordial spirits, and the literal meaning of their name.

The meaning of Aragorn's name Estel.
-----

(Translated words of Aragorn's mother Gilraen; The Lord of the Rings Appendix A I (iv), A Part of the Tale of Aragorn and Arwen)
-----
The translation of Aragorn's name Estel, given to him by his mother Gilraen.

* Horn-call of Buckland
The alarm-call of the Shire's Eastmarch.
 The alarm signal of the Hobbits of Buckland, calling them to action against invaders and incursions from the Old Forest.


* Hornblower Family|Hornblower
Producers of the Shire's most famous Pipe-weed.
 An old and important family of the Shire's Southfarthing. Its most famous member was Tobold Hornblower of Longbottom, who introduced pipe-weed into the Shire, and his family remained associated with industry. Their Longbottom Leaf variety was famous, and indeed barrels of Leaf bearing the Hornblower mark were found as far afield the ruins of Isengard.
 From Tobold's time, and perhaps earlier, the Hornblowers were one of the Shire's more important families. Frodo Baggins himself had Hornblower blood - his great-grandfather Largo married one Tanta Hornblower. The meaning of this old family name is unclear; perhaps one of Tobold's ancestors actually did blow a horn of some kind, or perhaps the name is a punning reference to pipe-smoking.

* House of Durin
Most noble of all Dwarvish lines.
 The line of the descendants of Durin the Deathless, hereditary Dwarven-kings of Durin's Folk. Thr?, Thr?n II and Thorin II Oakenshield were all descended from this House.


* House of Elendil
The line of the Kings of Gondor and Arnor.
 Elendil the son of Amandil was one of the greatest heroes of Tolkien's tales. With his two sons Isildur and An?ion, he escaped the Downfall of N?enor and founded two kingdoms in Middle-earth; Arnor in the north, and Gondor in the south. He ruled both of these as High King, and from his descendants came the line of Kings in both the North- and the South-kingdoms.
 Elendil himself was lost in the Siege of Barad-d?, and his elder son Isildur inherited the High Kingship. Two years later, Isildur himself, together with his three elder heirs, was lost in the Disaster of the Gladden Fields. His only remaining heir, Valandil, was only a boy, and so Arnor was effectively left without a King. Thus, the House of Elendil split into two lines. In the south, Isildur's nephew Meneldil had been left to rule Gondor in his uncle's name. Meneldil now took up the full Kingship of Gondor, and it was ruled by his descendants for more than two thousand years.
 When Valandil came of age, he inherited the northern lands of his father, Arnor. Valandil and his descendants ruled the North-kingdom for many generations, until dissent arose among the sons of the tenth King, E?endur. This conflict ultimately saw Arnor divided into three kingdoms; Arthedain, Cardolan and Rhudaur. E?endur's eldest son and true heir, Amlaith, took control of Arthedain, while his brothers took up rule in the other new lands. Arthedain endured for more than a thousand years, but eventually all three kingdoms of the Northern D?edain fell to the armies of Angmar.
 The line of Elendil was not broken in that defeat. The heir of Arvedui, the last King of Arthedain, was Aranarth. He took the title Chieftain of the D?edain, and his descendants led a proud but scattered people through the last millennium of the Third Age. The last Chieftain was Aranarth's heir through many generations: Aragorn, who united the Two Kingdoms after the War of the Ring and became the first King of the Reunited Kingdom.

* House of F?nor|House of Feanor
The house of Finw?s eldest son.
-----
"On the House of F?nor the wrath of the Valar lieth from the West unto the uttermost East, and upon all that will follow them it shall be laid also."
(From the Doom of Mandos; The Silmarillion 9, Of the Flight of the Noldor From the Doom of Mandos)
-----
The cursed descendants and followers of F?nor, the eldest son of Finw? and his spouse Nerdanel. F?nor was one of the greatest, and certainly the most skilled, of the Noldor, but his burning anger at the loss of his Silmarils led him to commit acts that would greatly diminish the influence of his house among his people. As the heir of Finw? F?nor and his descendants should have inherited the High Kingship of the Noldor, but because of F?nor's rash acts, the lordship of the Noldor passed to his brothers: Finarfin in Aman, and Fingolfin in Middle-earth. For this reason, the members of the House of F?nor are referred to as the Dispossessed.
 The history of the House was a woeful one, and most of its members met an early end. F?nor and six of his seven sons perished before the end of the First Age. His second son Maglor survived beyond the War of Wrath, wandering the shores of Middle-earth, but his fate is unknown. The last of the House was F?nor's grandson Celebrimbor, the son of Curufin, who had a great part in the making of the Rings of Power, and was tortured to death by Sauron during the Second Age.


* House of Finarfin
The house of Finw?s third son.
 The descendants and followers of Finarfin, third son of Finw? Finarfin himself remained in the West when the Noldor returned to Middle-earth, but his five children came to Beleriand. Both Finrod Felagund and Galadriel belonged to this house.


* House of Fingolfin
Royal house of the Noldor in Middle-earth.
 The House of the descendants and followers of Fingolfin, second son of Finw? who was accounted High King of the Noldor after the death of his elder brother F?nor in the first year of the First Age.
 During the early years of the First Age, the House of Fingolfin held the lands to the northwest of Beleriand; Hithlum, Nevrast and Gondolin. Of these, the city of Gondolin held until I 510, but Hithlum was overrun by Morgoth in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, where Fingon was slain (Fingolfin had already met his end in the Dagor Bragollach). The remnant of the House, including Fingon's son Ereinion Gil-galad, were succoured by C?dan the Shipwright in the Havens.
 After the Nirnaeth, Tuor son of Huor was sent as a messenger to Turgon in Gondolin, and there wedded Turgon's daughter Idril. Thus was the blood of Men introduced into the House, and the descendants of their line were named Half-elven, given the choice of whether they were to considered Men or Elves. All these descendants chose to be considered among the Firstborn, except Elrond's brother Elros (who became the first King of N?enor and was a direct ancestor of Aragorn II Elessar), and Elrond's daughter Arwen (Queen to Aragorn at the end of the Third Age).
 After the Fall of Gondolin, the survivors of the House lived as exiles at the Mouths of Sirion or in the Falas, until E?endil the Mariner, descendant of Fingolfin's second son Turgon, sailed into the West to seek the aid of the Valar, who overthrew Morgoth in the War of Wrath in c.583.
 The last High King of the Noldor, Ereinion Gil-galad, remained in Middle-earth. He dwelt in Lindon with his great-nephew Elrond and C?dan the Shipwright, and marched with the Last Alliance to Mordor at the end of the Second Age. There he fell in the Siege of Barad-d?, and the House of Fingolfin came to an end in Middle-earth.


* House of Hador
Third of the Three Houses of the Edain.
 The most renowned of the Three Houses of the Edain; the House of the descendants and followers of Hador L?indol. H?in Thalion, T?in Turambar, Huor and Tuor were all descended from this House.

 Second of the Three Houses of the Edain; the descendants of Haldad; the House was named for Haldad's daughter Haleth, who led the Haladin (as these people were known) from East Beleriand into the Forest of Brethil.


* House of H?in|House of Hurin
The House of the Stewards of Gondor.
 The descendants of H?in of Emyn Arnen, the Steward to King Minardil of Gondor. After H?in's time it became traditional for the Steward to be chosen from among his descendants, and ultimately the post became hereditary. After the loss of Gondor's last King, E?nur, the Stewards of the House of H?in took up the rule of the South-kingdom. Denethor, Boromir and Faramir were all descended from this House.


* House of Isildur
The descendants of Isildur, elder son of Elendil. The House came close to destruction at the beginning of the Third Age, when Isildur and his three eldest sons were lost at the Disaster of the Gladden Fields. His youngest son Valandil was kept safe in Rivendell, however, and from him came the line of the Kings of Arnor that led over three thousand years to Aragorn II Elessar.

-----

 A Man of the House of Haleth, the kinsman of Brandir. He went with T?in to the slaying of Glaurung, but was lost in the river as he climbed the Ravines of Teiglin.


* Hunting of the Wolf
The royal hunt for Carcharoth.
 At the gates of Angband, the mighty wolf Carcharoth had bitten Beren's hand from his wrist, and with it the Silmaril it held. The Silmaril was a hallowed jewel, and burned the innards of the evil monster. In searing pain, the wolf blindly chased through Beleriand and, breaking the Girdle of Melian, roamed madly through the lands of Doriath.
 King Thingol set out to hunt the wolf with the greatest of his warriors. With him went Mablung and Beleg, and Beren Erchamion, and Huan the Hound of Valinor. They found Carcharoth under the eaves of Neldoreth, drinking beneath a waterfall of the River Esgalduin. Eventually, after a mighty battle, Huan slew Carcharoth, but both he and Beren were mortally wounded.
 From the wolf's belly, Thingol recovered the Silmaril and carried it back to Menegroth. This was the same jewel that E?endil would bear as he sailed to Aman and that, according to legend, now shines as the Evening and the Morning Star.


* Huntsman of the Valar

* Huor
Son of Galdor of Dor-l?in, husband of R?n and father of Tuor; went to Gondolin with H?in his brother; slain in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad.
-----
Heroic grandfather of E?endil.
 Younger son of Galdor, Lord of Dor-l?in, and grandson of Hador L?indol, Tuor was in his turn the father of Tuor and grandfather of E?endil the Mariner. Huor had the fair hair and blue eyes of his grandfather's house, and was accounted one of the tallest of the Edain, second only to his own son Tuor.
 Following the custom of Men in those days, Huor and his elder brother H?in were fostered by the uncle Haldir, the lord of the Haladin of Brethil, and so they were dwelling in that forest at the time of the Dagor Bragollach in I 455. Though they were too young to go to open war (Huor was only thirteen years old at this time, and his brother sixteen), they went with the Haladin to destroy an orc-legion that had come to the forest.
 The Orcs were routed, and the forest had peace for many years after, but Huor and his brother were cut off from the main force. Ulmo sent a mist to aid their escape, and they retreated across the Brithiach into northern Dimbar, in the shadows of the Crissaegrim, the Encircling Mountains of Gondolin. Seeing that they were lost and weary, Thorondor sent two of his eagles to rescue them, and they were carried over the mountains into Turgon's Hidden Kingdom.
 Ulmo had warned Turgon to look favourably on the Men of the House of Hador, and so he welcomed the brothers, and they stayed in Gondolin for nearly a year. Although the law of Gondolin forbade any to leave who had entered the city, Turgon made an exception because the eagles had carried Huor and H?in, and so they had no clear idea where it lay. The eagles carried them away, and they returned to the house of Galdor in Dor-l?in. Turgon had bound them under an oath of silence, and it was never told where they had been for that year.
 When Huor had grown to manhood, he wedded R?n the daughter of Belegund, and they conceived a son, who Huor named before his birth, Tuor. Two months after the wedding, the elvenlords assembled a great army to assail Morgoth, and H?in and Huor went to join that army with the muster of Dor-l?in. This was the great battle that was to be called Nirnaeth Arnoediad, the Unnumbered Tears.
 Huor stood with the forces of his brother under the walls of the tower of High King Fingon at Barad Eithel, and their armies were arrayed in the woods on the eastern slopes of the Ered Wethrin, so that Morgoth could not descry their numbers. Turgon also came out of Gondolin with his armies for the first time since the city was built to join that battle.
 After six days of fighting, the battle turned to Morgoth and the Elves were routed. Turgon retreated south to return to his halls in Gondolin, and Huor and H?in, with the remnant of the forces of Dor-l?in, stood at his back to guard his withdrawal. Before they parted, Huor prophesied to Turgon that new hope would spring from the two of them, saying '... from you and from me a new star will arise'. This later proved to be true, for his son Tuor wedded Turgon's daughter Idril, and their son was E?endil the Blessed.
 Then came the last stand of the Men of Dor-l?in, who held the Pass of Sirion against the hosts of Orcs and creatures of the Enemy. They gave slowly back until they came to the Fen of Serech and the stream of Rivil, and there they and their host stood firm. As the day grew dark on that last desperate battle, Huor was slain, by a poisoned arrow in his eye.

-----

* H?in I (Steward of Gondor)|H?in|Hurin
The fifth Ruling Steward of Gondor.
 H?in I was the son of Belegorn, and descended in right line from H?in of Emyn Arnen, the founder of the House of H?in to which all the Ruling Stewards belonged. H?in's name was even more ancient than that of his illustrious ancestor - it is taken from H?in Thalion, a hero of the Edain in the First Age.
 H?in I ruled during the time of the Watchful Peace, during which Sauron had retreated into the East, and the Nazg? remained, threatening but silent, in Minas Morgul. The Peace would last long after H?in's time; it broke with the return of Sauron to Dol Guldur during the rule of H?in's descendant Denethor I, more than two hundred years after H?in's death.
 H?in ruled as Steward for forty years, and was succeeded by his son, who became T?in I.


* H?in II (Steward of Gondor)|H?in|Hurin
The fourteenth Ruling Steward of Gondor.
 The son of Steward Hallas, and grandson of the famous Cirion who granted the green northern lands of Calenardhon to the Rohirrim. H?in II shared his name with an illustrious line of predecessors, including H?in I who ruled during the Watchful Peace, H?in of Emyn Arnen who founded the house of the Stewards, and ultimately H?in Thalion himself, Lord of Dor-l?in in the First Age. H?in ruled Gondor as its Steward for twenty-three years, and was succeeded by his son, Belecthor I.


* H?in of Emyn Arnen|H?in|Hurin
Steward of King Minardil, from whom derived the House of the Stewards of Gondor.
-----
Ancestor of the Ruling Stewards of Gondor.
 H?in of Emyn Arnen is the earliest of Gondor's Stewards to have his name recorded in history. He served under King Minardil, and though we know little of his life, it is certain that his actions had a tremendous effect on the future history of Middle-earth. He was a Man of noble N?en?ean descent, the founder of the House of H?in from which Minardil's heirs came by tradition to select their own Stewards. By the time of the loss of Gondor's last King, E?nur, some four centuries later, the Stewardship had become a powerful hereditary institution, ready to take over in place of the Kings.
 To lay the groundwork for such an achievement, H?in must have provided some great service to the state of Gondor, but what that service might have been is not hinted at in The Lord of the Rings. However, the untimely death of his King, Minardil, followed almost immediately by the ravages of the Dark Plague, leave room for speculation that it was the efforts of H?in that directed Gondor through this dark time in its history. A short passage in The History of Middle-earth seems to confirm this: '...[H?in] had laboured greatly for the ordering of the realm in the disastrous days of the plague, when King Telemnar died within two years of the slaying of King Minardil by the Corsairs.' (Vol. XII The Peoples of Middle-earth I 7 The Heirs of Elendil).

N?en?ean stronghold in the valley called, after its occupation by the wizard Curun? (Saruman), Nan Curun?, at the southern end of the Misty Mountains; translation (to represent the language of Rohan) of the Sindarin Angrenost. See also Circle of Isengard.
-----
The fortress of Saruman.
 A Gondorian fortification at the southern end of the Misty Mountains, at the source of the River Isen. It was granted to the Wizard Saruman by Steward Beren of Gondor, and destroyed by the Ents during the War of the Ring, though its central tower of Orthanc remained standing.


* Isengarders|Isengarder
The soldiers of Isengard.
 A general term for the inhabitants and soldiers of Isengard, but used especially by Tolkien with reference to the servants of Saruman in the War of the Ring.


* Isengrim Took II|Isengrim Took
The founder of Great Smials.
 The twenty-second Shire-thain, the ninth descendant of Isumbras Took I to hold that title. He lived at the time when pipe-weed was introduced to the Shire; it was first grown just a few years before Isengrim became Thain. He is perhaps best known as the founder of Great Smials, which was to become the ancestral home of the Took family in the Tookland of the Shire.


* Isengrim Took III|Isengrim Took
The eldest of the twelve children of Gerontius, the Old Took. Because of his father's famous longevity, Isengrim was already an old Hobbit himself when he inherited the title of Thain, being no less than eighty-eight years old. He did not survive long in his new office, and died just ten years after his father. He was succeeded by his younger brother, who became Thain Isumbras Took IV.


* Isenmouthe|Carach Angren|Iron Jaws
The iron jaws to the south of Ud?.
 Called Carach Angren, the Iron Jaws, the Isenmouthe was the pass at the southern end of the valley of Ud? in northern Mordor, where it marched with the Plateau of Gorgoroth.


* Isil
Quenya name of the Moon.
-----
A name given to the Moon in Valinor by the Vanyar or Light Elves. It is said to mean 'the Sheen'.


* Isildur
Elder son of Elendil, who with his father and his brother An?ion escaped from the Drowning of N?enor and founded in Middle-earth the N?en?ean realms in exile; lord of Minas Ithil; cut the Ruling Ring from Sauron's hand; slain by Orcs in the Anduin when the Ring slipped from his finger.
-----
Eldest son and heir of Elendil, who cut the One Ring from the hand of Sauron after the Siege of Barad-d?. He was lost with his company and three eldest sons at the Disaster of the Gladden Fields early in the Third Age.
 The name means 'Devoted to the Moon'.


* Isildur's Bane|Bane of Isildur
Betrayer of the second Ring-bearer.
 A name for the One Ring. After Sauron's defeat in the War of the Last Alliance, Isildur Elendil's son took the Ring, and later journeyed northward with it to his kingdom of Arnor. Ambushed by Orcs, Isildur's small force was cut down, and he fled the battle wearing the Ring. It slipped from his finger, though, and so both Isildur and the Ring were lost.


* Isildur's Heir
The descendants of Elendil's eldest son.
 Isildur was the eldest son of Elendil, and so by right he and his heirs should have inherited the title of High King and ruled the Two Kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor. Soon after the defeat of Sauron at the end of the Second Age, though, Isildur and his three elder sons all perished in the Disaster of the Gladden Fields.
 Isildur's only remaining Heir was Valandil, kept safe in Rivendell but only eleven years old at that time, and unable to take up his rule. So, Isildur's nephew Meneldil took control of the kingdom of Gondor, and the Two Kingdoms split from one another. In the south, Gondor remained strong under the rule of Meneldil's descendants, but the North-kingdom was not so fortunate. It broke into three separate kingdoms, and was slowly overcome by dark forces of the neighbouring land of Angmar. Arvedui, Isildur's Heir through twenty-three generations, was the last King to rule in the north; he attempted to reclaim the High Kingship, but failed, and the last remnant of royal Arnor was overrun by its enemies.
 Now the line of Isildur in the north became forgotten by nearly all. Though their royal cities were wasted, and their people dwindled, the line of Isildur's Heirs continued for another sixteen generations under the title 'Chieftain of the D?edain'. The last Chieftain was Aragorn II of the War of the Ring, who famously came to Minas Tirith and reclaimed the High Kingship of all the western lands.


* Isilm?Isilme
Daughter of Tar-Elendil, sister of Silmarien.


* Isilmo
Son of Tar-S?ion; father of Tar-Minastir.
-----
Brother to Queen Tar-Telperi?.
 The second child of King Tar-S?ion of N?enor, younger brother to Tar-Telperi? the second Ruling Queen. Tar-Telperi? outlived her brother, but she had no consort, and so left no heir. The Sceptre therefore passed to Isilmo's son, who ruled as Tar-Minastir.


* Isle of Balar|Balar
The isle in the Bay of Balar, said to have been the eastern horn of Tol Eress? that broke away, where C?dan and Gil-galad dwelt after the Nirnaeth Arnoediad.
-----
Large island (indeed, the largest known island off the shores of Middle-earth) located in the Bay of Balar, some seventy miles south of the coastlands of Arvernien.
 According to legend, the Isle was the eastern horn of the much greater island of Tol Eress?, which broke off when Ulmo towed away the main island to Aman carrying the Vanyar and the Noldor. It is said that the Maia Oss?often came to the Isle of Balar.
 The island was noted for its pearls, which were found in great abundance in the shallow waters around it. These were collected by the people of C?dan, who gave them freely to the other Elf-lords.
 While we are not told of the nature or location of settlements on the island, it is clear that it was populated at least early in the First Age, and possibly before that. As well as the Elves of the Havens, Balar was explored by the people of Nargothrond, and Turgon built refuges there for the Gondolindrim after the Dagor Bragollach in I 455. From these, he sent out ships seeking Aman and the aid of the Valar, but none succeeded.
 The Isle of Balar became an important centre after the destruction of the Havens in I 472, when C?dan and Gil-galad fled to the island and settled there. While it is not stated certainly, it is likely that E?endil's ship Vingilot was built here, and that the Mariner set out for the West from C?dan's havens on the Island.


* Isle of Werewolves
Tol-in-Gaurhoth, the island of Sauron.
 A name for Tol Sirion after its capture by Morgoth, when it became infested by the evil servants of Sauron.


* Istar
A Quenya word meaning approximately 'Wise One', translated as 'Wizard'.


* Istari
The Maiar who were sent from Aman in the Third Age to resist Sauron; Sindarin Ithryn (see Ithryn Luin). Translated 'Wizards'. See Heren Istarion.
-----
The order of Wizards, the Maiar who came to Middle-earth after the first millennium of the Third Age. Of these, five came to the northwestern regions; Saruman, Gandalf, Radagast, Alatar and Pallando.


* Isumbras Took I|Isumbras Took
The thirteenth Thain of the Shire, and the first of the Took line. Isumbras I was a distant ancestor of Peregrin Took of the Company of the Ring.


* Isumbras Took III|Isumbras Took
The eleventh Thain of the Took line, and twenty-third overall, Isumbras succeeded his father Isengrim II. He had two sons, of whom the younger, Bandobras, became famous as the 'Bullroarer'. Isumbras' years as Thain were a time of hardship and privation - his son Bandobras beat back a raiding orc-band at the Battle of Greenfields, while the end of his Thainship saw the Long Winter fall on the Shire. He was succeeded by his elder son, who became Thain Ferumbras II.


* Isumbras Took IV|Isumbras Took
The twenty-eighth Thain of the Shire.
 The Old Took was Thain of the Shire for seventy-two years, so that his eldest son Isengrim was eighty-eight when he inherited the title. Due to his great age, Isengrim was Thain for just ten years, and was succeeded by his younger brother, who became Thain Isumbras IV. Isumbras was ninety-two years old when he inherited the title, and his Thainship was even shorter than his brother's - after nine years, he died, and was succeeded by his son Fortibras.


* Ithil
The Sindarin name for the Moon.
 The name for Isil, the Moon, in Sindarin. It appears only once in The Lord of the Rings, but is common in placenames, especially Minas Ithil, the Moontower, and Ithilien, the land where it stood.


* Ithil-stone|Stone of Ithil
The Palant? of Minas Ithil.
 The palant? that stood in Isildur's ancient fortress of Minas Ithil. It was captured by the Nazg? in the mid-Third Age, and was used by Sauron to entrap Saruman and Denethor during the War of the Ring.


* Ithilbor
Nandorin Elf, father of Saeros.


* Ithildin
The magical substance known as Starmoon.
 A magical substance made by the Elves from mithril, that could only be seen by the reflected light of the moon and stars, and even then remained hidden until a magical word was said. Gandalf translated its name as 'starmoon', but 'moon-sparkle' would be a more literal rendering. The designs on the West-gate of Moria were made from this substance.


* Ithilien
Territory of Gondor, east of Anduin; in the earliest time the possession of Isildur and ruled from Minas Ithil.
-----
The narrow lands of Gondor east of the Anduin.
 The lands of Gondor east of the River Anduin, on the borders of Mordor. With the capture of Minas Ithil, and the return of the Nazg? to the Black Land, Ithilien became a deserted country.


* Ithryn
The Sindarin name for the Istari or Wizards.


* Ithryn Luin|Ithron Luin
The two Istari who went into the East of Middle-earth and never returned (singular ithron). Translated 'Blue Wizards'.
-----
The Blue Wizards, Alatar and Pallando, who did not remain in the west of Middle-earth, but journeyed into its far eastern regions.


* Ivanneth
Sindarin name of the ninth month. See Yavanni?


* Ivrin
The lake and falls beneath Ered Wethrin where the river Narog rose.
-----
The pools at the source of the Narog.
 The pools that lay in the southern Ered Wethrin, and formed the source of the River Narog.


* Jewels of F?nor|Jewels of Feanor
Greatest of the works of the Elves.
 A name for the Silmarils, from F?nor their maker.


* Kalimac Brandagamba
The actual form of the Hobbit name anglicised by Tolkien as 'Meriadoc Brandybuck'.


* Karningul
The Westron name for Rivendell.
 The actual Westron name that Tolkien normally anglicises to Rivendell. Its meaning is equivalent to the English version, and to the Elvish Imladris, a deeply-cut, steep sided valley.


* Keepers of the Three Rings
Those who bore Narya, Nenya and Vilya.
 Those who held the Three Rings of the Elves after their making, through more than 4,000 years of the Second and Third Ages. At the end of the Third Age, when the Rings finally lost their power and were taken into the West, the Keepers were Elrond, Galadriel and Gandalf.


* Kelvar
An Elvish word retained in the speeches of Yavanna and Manw?in The Silmarillion 'animals, living things that move'.


* Kement?i|Kementari
A title of the Vala Yavanna, meaning 'Queen of the Earth'.


* Key of Orthanc
The Key to Saruman's Tower.
 The key or keys that granted entry to the otherwise impenetrable tower of Orthanc. They first enter history at the time of the Oath of Eorl, when that tower was sealed by the Gondorians, and the key taken to Minas Tirith. At the request of Saruman, Steward Beren later surrendered the key to him, and he took up his abode in the ancient Gondorian stronghold.


* Kham?|Khamul|Black Easterling|Shadow of the East
Nazg?, second to the Chief; dwelt in Dol Guldur after its reoccupation in Third Age 2951.
-----
Called the Shadow of the East, Kham? was the second of the nine Ringwraiths, second only to the Lord of the Nazg?, and referred to as Sauron's lieutenant.


* Khand
Land south-east of Mordor.
-----
Ancient eastern ally of Sauron.
 A little-known land lying directly to the east of Mordor, and its traditional ally.


* Khaz?|Khazad
The race of Dwarves.
 The Dwarves' name for their own kind, in the Dwarvish language Khuzdul; seen in the Dwarvish name for Moria, 'Khazad-d?'.


* Khazad-d?|Khazad-dum
The great mansions of the Dwarves of Durin's race in the Misty Mountains (Hadhodrond, Moria). See Khaz?; d? is probably a plural or collective, meaning 'excavations, halls, mansions'.
-----
The Mansions of Durin and his Kin.
 The grandest and most famous of the mansions of the Dwarves. It lay in the central parts of the Misty Mountains, tunnelled and carved through the living rock of the mountains themselves, so that a traveller could pass through it from the west of the range to the east. It was founded in very ancient days by Durin the Deathless, who came upon a shimmering lake beneath the mountain Celebdil, with a crown of stars reflected in its waters. He named that lake in the Dwarvish tongue, Kheled-z?am, the Mirrormere, and there he started the building of Khazad-d?.
 As the millennia passed, the descendants of Durin sat upon the throne of Khazad-d?, and their cavernous city became famous throughout the world. It even has a passing mention in Quenta Silmarillion, the tale of the Elf-lords and their wars far to the west, though to them it was no more than a distant rumour they heard from the Dwarves of the Blue Mountains on their borders. In the Second Age, Noldor out of Lindon founded a country of their own by the western gates of Khazad-d?. A rare friendship sprang up between the Dwarves and the Elves of this new land, Eregion. Eregion's ruler, Celebrimbor, helped to construct the famous and magical gate that became known as the West-gate of Moria, and indeed went so far as to present King Durin III with a Ring of Power. The friendship of Khazad-d? and Eregion came to a sudden end, though, in II 1697, when Sauron overran the country of the Elves, and the doors of Khazad-d? were sealed against his forces.
 Eventually, Sauron was driven back and Khazad-d? continued to thrive. Much of its great wealth was based on the mithril that was found in its mines, and as the centuries passed, the Dwarves mined deeper and deeper for the precious metal. In the year III 1980, they dug too deep, and unleashed a nameless terror from the depths beneath the city. The creature wreaked dreadful destruction, and in slaying the then King, Durin VI, became known as Durin's Bane. In the following year, Durin's son, N?n I, was also lost, and the Dwarves fled their ancient home. After millennia as one of the richest cities in Middle-earth, Khazad-d? stood dark and empty, but for the brooding menace the Dwarves had released. In that time it was given a new name, Moria, the Black Pit.
 The monster of Moria - a Balrog of Morgoth, as was later known - lurked alone in Moria for nearly five hundred years. After that time, the old city of Khazad-d? began to be peopled again, but not by Dwarves. Sauron directed his creatures there, and it began to fill with Orcs and Trolls. Though the Orcs' numbers were greatly reduced in the Battle of Nanduhirion, fought in the valley beneath Moria's East-gate in III 2799, the Balrog could not be bested, and Khazad-d? remained a citadel of darkness.
 There were two attempts by the Dwarves of Durin's line to reclaim their ancient home. The first of these was by Balin, who led a force of Dwarves there from Erebor in III 2989, but though he was successful at first, he was eventually defeated and slain. The story of the second attempt to recolonise the Dwarf-mansions is less clear, but it seems that after several centuries, Durin VII became King of Durin's Folk, and led a further return to the citadel. It seems he was successful, so that long after the War of the Ring, the Dwarves of Durin's line reclaimed their inheritance, and the hammers rang again in their great halls beneath the Misty Mountains.


* Kheled-z?am|Kheled-zaram
The shimmering Mirrormere.
 The shimmering mere that lay in the eastern valleys of the Misty Mountains; seeing it, and the stars that were always reflected in its surface, Durin the Deathless chose that place for the delving of Khazad-d?.


* Kh?|Khim
Son of M? the Petty-dwarf, slam by Andr?, one of T?in's outlaw band.


* Khuzdul
The secret tongue of the Dwarves.
 The Dwarves' name for their own secret language, of which only a few words were ever discovered by outsiders. With the exception of a few fragments and place-names, Tolkien gives us little insight into the Dwarvish tongue (as the Dwarves kept their tongue secret, it is natural that little of it should have survived in records). Our main sources are in words such as Khazad-d? (Khaz? being Dwarvish for 'Dwarves') and Khuzdul itself, and in the Dwarvish war-cry, 'Baruk Khaz?! Khaz? aim?u!' ('Axes of the Dwarves! The Dwarves are upon you!).
 During the Third Age, the Dwarves seem to have considered Khuzdul in much the same way as the Elves of Middle-earth looked on Quenya, as an ancient and noble tongue of the past. The Dwarves would more commonly speak, even among themselves, in the native tongues of the regions in which they lived, to the extent that they took their names from these languages.
 The Dwarves also had secret 'inner' names, presumably derived from the Khuzdul tongue, but they were extremely secretive about these, to the extent that they were not even given on their owners' tombs.


* K?i|Kili
Nephew of Thorin II Oakenshield, who accompanied him on the Quest of Erebor, and was slain at his side in the Battle of Five Armies.


* Kin-strife
The Gondorian civil war.
 The civil war that erupted in Gondor in the middle of the Third Age. Eldacar, the rightful heir of King Valacar, had been raised in a foreign country, and his right to the Kingship was therefore challenged by Castamir, who himself had some claim on the throne. Castamir succeeded in usurping the Kingship, but held it just ten years before Eldacar reclaimed it and restored order.


* Kindler
A translation of Tintall? a title given to Varda after she kindled the brighter stars with the dews of Telperion.


* Kine of Araw
The legendary cattle of Rh?.
 The oxen that lived on the lands around the Sea of Rh? were hardier and wilder than any others in Middle-earth. Legends claimed that they were descended from the cattle of the Huntsman of the Valar, Orom?himself, and so they were named the Kine of Araw (Araw being the Sindarin form of Orom?s name).
 The Kine were famous as the quarry of Vorondil the Hunter, ancestor of the Ruling Stewards of Gondor. It was he who cut a horn from one of these beasts and fashioned a hunting-horn from it, which came to be carried by the eldest son of the Ruling Steward from Vorondil's time onward. The last heir to bear the horn was Boromir, who saw it broken in two in his battle with Orcs beneath Amon Hen.


* King of Arda
The most powerful of the Valar.
 A title given to Manw?S?imo, greatest of the Valar, and held to be the ruler of the realm of Arda.


* King of Arnor
High title of the Heirs of Isildur.
 Title of ten lords of the D?edain, from Elendil to E?endur. E?endur's eldest son, Amlaith, became the first King of Arthedain.


* King of Arthedain
Successors to the Kings of Arnor.
 Title of fifteen lords of the D?edain, from Amlaith of Fornost to Arvedui Last-king. Arvedui's eldest son, Aranarth, became the first Chieftain of the D?edain.


* King of Dale
The title claimed by Bard.
 The title of the hereditary rulers of Dale after its refounding by Bard, which was held successively by his descendants Bain, Brand and Bard II. It was likely also held by Bard's ancestors down to Girion, but there is no definite evidence of this.


* King of Doriath
The royal title of Thingol and his Heir.
 The title of two Elf-lords of the Sindar, who ruled the kingdom of Doriath for many centuries from its foundation long before the beginning of the First Age to its destruction at the hands of the Sons of F?nor.
-----
1- Elu Thingol: The founder of Doriath with his queen, Melian. He was lord there for millennia, and in that time his realm was protected from foes by the Girdle of Melian. Thingol was slain by Dwarves in approximately I 505, and Melian departed from the realm. He was succeeded by his grandson, the son of his daughter L?hien.
2- Dior Eluch?: After Thingol's death he came to Menegroth and ruled the kingdom of his grandfather. After the passing of L?hien, the Silmaril she had borne was brought to Doriath, and the Sons of F?nor assailed the citadel of Menegroth to recover it. There Dior was slain, and the kingdom ended.


* King of Durin's Folk
The royal line of the Longbeards.
 Title given to Durin the Deathless and his descendants who ruled the Dwarves of Durin's Folk. Famous among these were Thorin II Oakenshield, who reclaimed Erebor from Smaug, and D?n II Ironfoot, who fought in the War of the Ring.
 No complete list of the Kings is known. The table below shows the names of those Kings who have been recorded, or whose existence can be deduced. As the descendants of Durin were forced by circumstance to travel widely in Middle-earth, the main seat(s) of their Kingship is shown alongside each King.
-----
- Durin I (Khazad-d?): One of the seven Fathers of the Dwarves, and the founder of the Longbeards, Durin's Folk. He ruled his people for centuries - so long, in fact, that he became known as the 'Durin the Deathless' - but eventually he passed away. From time to time over the millennia, one among Durin's descendants would arise so similar in bearing to his ancient ancestor that he, too, would be given the name 'Durin'.
- Durin II (Khazad-d?): We know nothing of this King, except that the appearance of his descendant Durin III in the middle years of the Second Age shows that he must have ruled in Khazad-d? at some time before that.
- Durin III (Khazad-d?): The ruler of Khazad-d? at the time of the forging of the Rings of Power, Durin III was a great friend of Celebrimbor the Lord of Eregion to the west. He received one of the Rings (later known as the Ring of Thr?) as a gift from his friend.
- Durin IV, Durin V (Khazad-d?): Like Durin II, we know nothing of the reigns of these two Kings, except that they must have ruled during the late Second Age or earlier Third Age. We can safely deduce their existence because we know that Durin VI took the throne in the late second millennium of the Third Age.
- Durin VI (Khazad-d?): (Ruled to III 1980) The first King of Durin's Folk for whom we have specific dates was Durin VI, who ruled in Khazad-d? at the time the Balrog was awoken. It slew Durin, for which reason it became known as Durin's Bane. Durin was succeeded briefly by his son.
- N?n I (Khazad-d?): (Ruled 1 year to III 1981) He ruled for just a year in Khazad-d? before he too was slain by the Balrog. He was succeeded by his son.
- Thr?n I (Erebor): (Ruled 209 years to III 2190) He led a great part of his people away from Khazad-d? into the north and east of Middle-earth. It was Thr?n who founded the great Dwarf-kingdom of Erebor, the Lonely Mountain above the Long Lake. He was succeeded by his son.
- Thorin I (Grey Mountains): (Ruled 99 years to III 2289) Discerning that the great host of his people were gathering in the northern range of the Grey Mountains, Thorin I abandoned Erebor and removed there. He was succeeded by his son.
- Gl?n (Grey Mountains): (Ruled 96 years to III 2385) He continued the rule of Durin's Folk in the Grey Mountains, was succeeded by his son.
- ?n (Grey Mountains): (Ruled 103 years to III 2488) He was succeeded by his son.
- N?n II (Grey Mountains): (Ruled 97 years to III 2585) In his time, the prosperous Dwarves began to suffer attacks by the dragons of the north. He was succeeded by his son.
- D?n I (Grey Mountains): (Ruled 4 years to III 2589) His short reign came to a swift end when he was slain by a cold-drake before his own doors. He was succeeded by the eldest of his three sons.
- Thr? (Erebor): (Ruled 201 years to III 2790) He led his people out of the dragon-infested north back to the Lonely Mountain, while his younger brother Gr? led some part of their people further east, to settle in the Iron Hills. He had been King under the Mountain for more than 180 years when the great dragon Smaug descended on his kingdom and sacked it. He escaped the destruction with his son and grandson, and went wandering in the wild. Eventually reaching his people's ancient home of Khazad-d?, he found it infested with Orcs. His death at the hands of their leader, Azog, sparked the War of the Dwarves and Orcs. He was succeeded by his son.
- Thr?n II (Dunland, Blue Mountains): (Ruled 60 years to III 2850) He avenged his father's death with the defeat of Azog's Orcs at the Battle of Azanulbizar. In the early part of his reign, he dwelt in Dunland, but he later moved northward to the Blue Mountains west of Eriador. Before his reign ended, he resolved to return to Erebor, but wandering in the wild he was captured by evil things, and died in the dungeons of the Necromancer. He was succeeded by his eldest son.
- Thorin II (Blue Mountains): (Ruled 91 years to III 2941) He ruled as King in the Blue Mountains for many years, but like his father before him he at last determined to return to his ancient home of Erebor. Accompanied by Gandalf and Bilbo Baggins, he led a troop of companions into the far east, and against all hope recovered the Lonely Mountain from Smaug. After Smaug's death, the Battle of Five Armies was fought beneath Erebor, and Thorin was slain. The only remaining descendants of Thr?'s line, Thorin's young nephews F?i and K?i, were also lost in the battle. So the descent of the Kingship passed to the line of Thr?'s younger brother Gr?, and specifically to Gr?'s grandson D?n Ironfoot.
- D?n II (Erebor): (Ruled 78 years to III 3019) He ruled in prosperity as King under the Mountain for many years until the time of the War of the Ring. He was slain in that war, in the Battle of Dale, and succeeded by his son.
- Thorin III (Erebor): He was besieged in Erebor for seven days after the loss of his father, but when news reached the forces of Sauron that their master had been defeated, he was able to drive them back. With Thorin III, detailed records of the reigns of the Kings come to an end, but we have a record of just one of his descendants.
- Durin VII (Khazad-d??): He was said to be the last of the Durins to rule over Durin's Folk. Durin's Bane had been destroyed in the War of the Ring, so that Khazad-d? lay open for recovery by its ancient owners, and there is some evidence that it was Durin VII who at last achieved this.
-----
We know that Durin I died before the end of the First Age, so that between his rule and that of Thorin III, the Kings of Durin's line ruled for a period of about 6,500 years. Given that the average length of a reign among the Longbeards seems to have been roughly a century, we can deduce that there are probably about fifty Kings' names missing from this list.


* King of Eagles
A title given to Thorondor, the gigantic and noble eagle of the First Age, whose talons wounded the face of Morgoth himself. Thorondor dwelt among the peaks of the Crissaegrim, guarding Turgon's Hidden City of Gondolin from the forces of Morgoth until that city's Fall, and he came to the aid of the Elves many times during the First Age.
 In The Hobbit, we meet a character who carries the title 'Lord of Eagles', a title that was also borne by Thorondor in the Elder Days. Whether the title of 'King of Eagles' was also passed down through the Ages like this cannot be known - in Tolkien's writings, it is only ever used of Thorondor himself.


* King of Gondolin
A title only ever borne by Turgon.
 Title of Turgon son of Fingolfin, who founded Gondolin in the early First Age and ruled it until its Fall.


* King of Gondor
The line of lords descended from Elendil's son An?ion.
 The title of the lords of the D?edain, Elendil and his descendants, who ruled theKingdom of Gondor. The line of the Kings came to an end when E?nur answered the challenge of the Lord of the Nazg? and was lost in Minas Morgul. After his loss, Gondor was ruled by hereditary Stewards until the installation of Aragorn II Elessar (a direct descendant of Elendil) after the War of the Ring.
-----
1- Elendil (Ruled for 121 years to II 3441): He founded both Arnor and Gondor, and ruled the two kingdoms as High King. His royal seat was in his own capital in the north, Ann?inas, and during his reign, Gondor was under the direct command of his two sons, Isildur and An?ion. He formed the Last Alliance, and marched to the defeat of Sauron, but he himself was lost in that great victory.
2- Isildur (Ruled for 2 years to III 2): He succeeded his father as High King, but before departing into the north, spent time ordering the South-kingdom. In the second year of the Third Age, he left Gondor in the care of his nephew Meneldil, the son of his brother An?ion, and rode away into the north. On his journey, Isildur was ambushed by Orcs and slain, and so the Kingship of Gondor passed on to Meneldil and his heirs.
3- Meneldil (Ruled for 156 years to III 158): Isildur was lost with his three eldest sons, leaving just his fourth son Valandil, then a mere boy, as heir. At thistime Meneldil took on the full Kingship of Gondor, and its Kings through the next thirty generations would be his descendants.
4- Cemendur (Ruled for 80 years to III 238).

His Queen, Ber?hiel, was sent into exile, and so he was the first of Gondor's Kings to die childless. He was succeeded by his nephew, the son ofhis brother Tarciryan.
13- E?nil I (Ruled for 23 years to III 936): The second Ship-king famously captured the southern Haven of Umbar for Gondor, expanding its boundaries even farther. He was lost in a storm off the very coastshe had conquered.

16- Atanatar II (Ruled for 77 years to III 1226): Because of the extent and wealth of his realm, he was called Alcarin, Atanatar the Glorious, though he lacked the adventuring warrior spirit of his predecessors.
17- Narmacil I (Ruled for 68 years to III 1294): Narmacil tired of the cares of Kingship, and appointed a Regent to manage the Kingdom for him. This was his nephew Minalcar, who would one day rule in his own stead as R?endacil II. He died without issue, and was succeeded instead by his younger brother.
18- Calmacil (Ruled for 10 years to III 1304): Throughout his brief reign, his son Minalcar maintained his role as Regent.
19- R?endacil II (Ruled for 62 years to III 1366): After sixty-four years as Regent, Minalcar took the throne in his own right. In memory of a great victory over the Easterlings he had won in his Regency, he became King in the name R?endacil II.He made diplomatic efforts in the east, allying himself with tribes of Northmen in Rhovanion as a bulwark against further Easterling invasions. He sent his son Valacar as an ambassador to the Northmen, and while R?endacil still held the throne, Valacar wedded Vidumavi in the east, who bore him a son.
20- Valacar (Ruled for 66 years to III 1432): Valacar was a controversial and disputed King, especially because his heir carried the bloodof the Northmen. In the later part of Valacar's reign, true rebellion broke out, and the southern provinces of Gondor began to break away.
21- Eldacar (Ruled intermittently for 48 years to III 1490): After the half-Gondorian Eldacar took the throne, the rebellions of Valacar's time grew into a full civil war, and after five years as King Eldacar was deposed by Castamir the Usurper. For ten years he hid in the east, gatheringhis forces, and then challenged Castamir for his rightful Kingship, slaying theUsurper himself. After regaining his throne, he reigned for another forty-three years before his death.
22- Castamir (Ruled for 10 years to III 1447): The Usurper of Eldacar's throne was descended from the royal line (he was the great-grandson of Calmacil) and is considered a King of Gondor in his own right. He reigned for just ten years, as unrest among his subjects grew, after which Eldacar attacked fromthe east and reclaimed the throne of Gondor.
23- Aldamir (Ruled for 50 years to III 1540): Aldamir was the younger son of Eldacar (his elder brother Ornendil had been put to death by Castamir). In histime there was war in Gondor with the peoples of the south, and Aldamir fell in that war.
24- Hyarmendacil II (Ruled for 81 years to III 1621): Aldamir's son avenged his father by overcoming the Haradrim, and in token of this took the name of Hyarmendacil, 'South-victor', the second of Gondor's Kings to bear that auspicious name.
25- Minardil (Ruled for 13 years to III 1634): Minardil's was a brief reign. He was at the port of Pelargir when it fell under attack by the Corsairs of Umbar, and he was slain in that attack.
26- Telemnar (Ruled for 2 years to III 1636): Telemnar's reign was even shorter than that of his father. He was lost with all his children in the Dark Plague, and his line came to an end.
27- Tarondor (Ruled for 162 years to III 1798): Tarondor came early to the Kingship, and enjoyed the longest rule of any of Gondor's Kings. His realm had been devastated by war and plague, and he worked to rebuild its power. It was Tarondor who moved the King's House from Osgiliath to Minas Anor.
28- Telumehtar Umbardacil (Ruled for 52 years to III 1850): Telumehtar is most remembered by history as the King who reconquered Umbar to the south, and from this deed he took his name Umbardacil 'Victor over Umbar'.
29- Narmacil II (Ruled for 6 years to III 1856): In Narmacil's time, Gondor's wars with the fierce Wainriders began; they emerged suddenly out of the east, and Narmacil's short reign came to an end in their violent assault.
30- Calimehtar (Ruled for 80 years to III 1936): Calimehtar reversed his father's defeat, and secured a famous victory over the Wainriders on the plain of Dagorlad. Nonetheless they were not destroyed, and their threat remained on Gondor's eastern borders.
31- Ondoher (Ruled for 8 years to III 1944): Like his father and grandfather before him, Ondoher went to war with the Wainriders. They had made alliance with the Men of Khand and of Harad, so that all of Gondor's bitterest foes attacked at one time. Under its great general E?nil, Gondor had the victory at the Battle of the Camp, but Ondoher was lost in those wars, as were his two sons Artamir and Faramir.
-Interregnum- (1 year to III 1945): After the loss of Ondoher and his sons, Gondor was left without a clear heir to its throne. Arvedui of Arthedainmade a claim, based on his descent from Isildur Gondor's second King, but this claim was rejected. Instead, the Crown was given to the commander who had saved the South-kingdom, E?nil, who as a great-great-grandson of Telumehtar was properly a member of the Royal House.
32- E?nil II (Ruled for 98 years to III 2043): E?nil ruled Gondor during a time a turmoil across Middle-earth. In the north, the last kingdom of the D?edain was overrun by the Witch-king, and though E?nil's son E?nur travelled north to the aid of Arthedain, he came too late, though he did achieve the destruction of Angmar. The Lord of the Nazg? returned to Mordor from that defeat, and later in E?nil's reign the Nazg? launched an assault on Minas Ithil, Gondor's great citadel on the borders of Mordor, and captured it. After that time Minas Ithil was known as MinasMorgul, and Minas Anor as Minas Tirith.
33- E?nur (Ruled for 7 years to III 2050): E?nur had reigned for just seven years when he foolishly took up a challenge fromthe Lord of the Nazg?, and rode willingly to Minas Morgul. He was never heard from again, and his loss left Gondor without a King once more.
-Interregnum- (969 years to III 3019): For nearly a millennium after E?nur's loss, Gondor had no King. It was ruled by the Stewards, the loyal hereditary servants of the Kings descended from H?in of Emyn Arnen, Steward to King Minardil. There were twenty-six Ruling Stewards, from Mardil Voronw?to Denethor II, in whose time one came toGondor with a true claim to its Kingship.
34- Aragorn Elessar (Ruled for 122 years to IV 120): Aragorn was the long-lost Heir of Isildur out of the north, the direct descendant of Gondor's first and second Kings, who came into his title at the time of the War of the Ring, and was crowned in the year of the Downfall of Barad-d?. He reunited the North- and South- Kingdoms; his Queen was Arwen, the daughter of Elrond, and his heir was their son Eldarion.
35- Eldarion (Ruled from IV 120): Little is known of Aragorn's son Eldarion but his name, and the fact that he succeeded his father to carry the royal line on into the Fourth Age.


* King of Khazad-d?
Ruler of Durin's city in the Misty Mountains.
 The title taken by the rulers of Khazad-d?, the greatest and most opulent Dwarf-city of all time. The Kings were descended in line from Durin I, called the Deathless, who founded the city in ancient days.
 After the foundation of the line by Durin, little is said of the most ancient Kings. What records we have show that they ruled, on average, for about a century each, which would mean that there must have been very roughly sixty generations of Kings of Khazad-d? before records resume, in the eighteenth century of the Third Age. The first King listed there, the penultimate King in Khazad-d?, was Durin VI, so it follows that there must have been a Durin II, III, IV and V among the many unknown Kings (indeed we have some records of Durin III, who received a Ring of Power from Celebrimbor himself).
 It was Durin VI who had the misfortune to rule Khazad-d? at the time its miners discovered and released a sleeping menace deep among their mithril veins. This was the Balrog that came to be known as Durin's Bane, a creature much too powerful for the Dwarves to control. Durin was killed soon after its appearance, and succeeded by his son, N?n I. N?n's rule was a short one - he too was killed within a year of his father's death, and his subjects fled their ancient home.
 According to legend, N?n I was not the last King of Khazad-d?. Some sources suggest that his distant descendant, Durin VII, came back to the kingdom of his ancestor, and reclaimed it as its King, though this tale cannot be verified beyond doubt.

* King of the Sea
A title of Ulmo and of Ar-Pharaz?.
-----
"... the arising of the King of the Sea was terrible, as a mounting wave that strides to the land..."
(Valaquenta)
-----
A title primarily given to the Vala Ulmo, whose special province was the oceans, seas and waters of the Earth. Ulmo not only ruled the Sea, he also dwelt in its depths, and so lived apart from the other Valar.
 The title 'King of the Sea' also appears in Akallab?h, but there it is given not to Ulmo, but to Ar-Pharaz?, the last King of N?enor, as he sails on Middle-earth to defeat Sauron.


* King of the West
A title given to Aragorn.
 A title taken by Aragorn Elessar on his accession to the throne of Gondor, signifying his Kingship over all the Free Peoples of the West, from the north to the south.
 In both the North- and South-kingdoms of the D?edain, there had been no King for many centuries. At the time of Aragorn's coronation, there had been no King of Gondor for 969 years, and no King of a united Arnor for 2,158 years. The last King to rule both realms jointly had been Aragorn's distant ancestor Isildur, though his Kingship was cut short at the the Disaster of the Gladden Fields before he could truly take up the rule of his twin realms.
 From that time, when the Third Age was just two years old, the West had had no uniting King. At the coronation of Aragorn, two years from the Age's end, Arnor and Gondor were at last united once again, and Aragorn's rule of the West is therefore referred to as the Reunited Kingdom.

-----
Title of the Dwarf-lords of Erebor.
 The title taken by Thr?n I, founder of the Dwarf-kingdom at Erebor, the Lonely Mountain, and maintained by those Kings of Durin's Folk who dwelt there.

-----
The childhood friend of T?in.
 The name, said to mean 'hopafoot', given by T?in to Sador. Sador was a lame servant of T?in's father H?in, who befriended the tragic hero in his youth.


* Ladros
The lands to the north-east of Dorthonion that were granted by the Noldorin Kings to the Men of the House of B?r.
-----
The northeastern reaches of Dorthonion.
 A highland region to the northeast of Dorthonion. It was held briefly as a fief by the House of B?r, but lost to Morgoth in the Dagor Bragollach.
 The region of Ladros seems originally to have been a fief of Finrod Felagund (at least, his brothers Angrod and Aegnor held 'the northern slopes of Dorthonion', according to Quenta Silmarillion, Of Beleriand and its Realms). Finrod later assigned this land to Boromir of the House of B?r, whose members had long been loyal in his service.
 Of the House of B?r, there were three lords of Ladros - Boromir himself, his son Bregor, and Bregor's son Barahir. In Barahir's time, Morgoth overwhelmed Dorthonion and Ladros in the Dagor Bragollach: Barahir and twelve faithful Men, including his son Beren, became outlaws in their own land, assaulting Morgoth's forces from their hidden lair at Tarn Aeluin on Ladros' southern borders. They were betrayed by Gorlim the Unhappy, and all were slain but Beren, who escaped into the south. After this time, Ladros fell under the yoke of Morgoth until it was swallowed by the Great Sea at the end of the First Age.
 In the Narn i H? H?in (published by Christopher Tolkien in Unfinished Tales of N?enor and Middle-earth), T?in Turambar is given the title 'heir of Dor-l?in and Ladros'. This seems inconsistent with the published Silmarillion: T?in was descended from the House of Hador, not that of B?r. Perhaps this birthright came from his mother, Morwen, who was the granddaughter of Barahir's brother Bregolas.

* Light-elves|Light-elf|Light Elves|Light Elf
The followers of Ingw?
 A name given to the Vanyar, the kindred of the Elves who came first to Valinor and dwelt long ages in the light of the Two Trees.
 This is an old and rare term, used just once in The Hobbit and never again in any canonical source. This is probably to avoid confusion with 'Elves of the Light', the Calaquendi, of whom the Light-elves formed just one part, together with the Noldor and many of the Teleri (the Deep-elves and Sea-elves mentioned in The Hobbit).


* Lily Baggins
A great-aunt of Bilbo Baggins, Lily married Togo Goodbody and had many descendants.

* Limlaith
The Elves' name for the river otherwise called the Limlight.
 A river that flowed out of the northern parts of Fangorn Forest, and flowed eastward to join the Anduin in its building southward rush. In ancient days, it marked the northernmost point of Calendardhon, and hence of Gondor's borders, but at the time of the War of the Ring, it lay on the borders of Rohan.

* Lithlad

 The ashen plain that lay beneath Mordor's northern mountain-wall, the Ered Lithui. It lay in the east of that land, beyond Gorgoroth and the Barad-d?.


* Little Delving
A small village near Michel Delving.
 A village of the Shire. Though its existence can be inferred from the name 'Michel Delving', the only direct evidence for it appears on the Shire map in The Lord of the Rings, where a road leading off to the northwest is marked 'To Little Delving'.


* Little Folk
A name among Men for the Hobbits.
 A term for the small race of people more commonly known as Hobbits, especially used by the taller Men (who were in turn referred to as the Big Folk).
 The origins of the Little Folk are mysterious. They were evidently an ancient branch of the human race, but they developed in the mysterious east of Middle-earth, and how they came by their small stature and peculiar habits is unknown. By the time they entered history, in the year 1050 of the Third Age, they had already broken into three distinct groups, the Harfoots, the Fallohides and the Stoors.
 Over the next two thousand years, the Little Folk spread slowly across the Western lands. By III 1601, they had acquired a land for themselves, that they called the Shire. Despite many hardships, the Shire would survive until the time of the War of the Ring and beyond. Though their land did not survive to our own time, Tolkien's words in the Prologue to The Lord of the Ring suggest that the Little Folk themselves are not extinct, but continue a secret, hidden existence alongside us, the bumbling Big Folk.


* Little Gelion

-----
The lesser of Gelion's two sources.
 A lesser river that rose beneath Himring in the north marches of Beleriand, whose spring was close by that of the Celon.

* Lockholes
The short-lived prison cells of Michel Delving.
 When the Shire was taken over by Sharkey's Men during the War of the Ring, the storage tunnels of Michel Delving were converted into the so-called Lockholes.

-----
The N?en?ean port on the Gwathl?
 A great haven built by the N?en?eans at the mouth of the River Gwathl?or Greyflood. It was an important N?en?ean base throughout much of the Second Age.


* Lone-lands
The wide lands of Eriador.
 The name among Men and Hobbits for the wide region of northern Middle-earth that lay between the Blue Mountains in the west and the Misty Mountains in the east. They are more commonly known by their Elvish name, Eriador.


* Lonely Isle
Tol Eress?, the island off the eastern shores of Aman where many of the Elves dwelt. The name probably comes from its early history, when it stood in the middle of the Great Sea, far from either Aman or Middle-earth.


* Lonely Mountain
The Dwarf-kingdom of Erebor.
 The mountain that stood alone in the east of Middle-earth where the Dwarves founded the kingdom of Erebor, which was destroyed by the dragon Smaug, and refounded by Thorin II Oakenshield.


* Long Horn
The nickname of Holman Cotton.
 The nickname of Rose Cotton's grandfather, Holman Cotton of Bywater. It originally appeared in the form 'Long Holm', and so apparently referred to Holman's unusual height.


* Long Lake
The lake south of Eriador into which flowed both the Forest River and the River Running, and on which Esgaroth (Lake Town) was built.
-----
The lake on which Esgaroth stood.
 The lake that lay to the south of Erebor and Dale, the site of Lake-town, home of the trading people of the Lake-men.


* Long Wall
The Andram of Beleriand.
 The range of hills that marked a steep fall in the height of the land of Beleriand, more usually called by its Elvish name, the Andram. Its western end was in the hills east of Nargothrond and from there it ran far into East Beleriand, where it ended at the hills of Ramdal, 'Wall's End'.


* Long Winter
The winter of Third Age 2758-9.
-----
The worst winter in the history of Middle-earth.
 A period of five months between November III 2758 and March III 2759, during which time the western lands, and especially Eriador and Rohan, were beset by snow and ice. This was a catastrophic time, the Winter and the hard years that followed it cost many lives, and brought the land of Rohan near to extinction. The Long Winter is not to be confused with the Fell Winter, which occurred some 153 years later.


* Long-worms|Long-worm
Scatha and his kind.
 A type of dragon found in the northern parts of Middle-earth, and perhaps elsewhere. The most famous long-worm (and in fact that only one that Tolkien explicitly identifies) was Scatha of the Ered Mithrin, who preyed on the Dwarves and Men of the Grey Mountains, and was slain by Fram of the ?th?d.
 Though Tolkien gives almost no clues about long-worms in the text of The Lord of the Rings, his illustrations of dragons give us some further hints. Tolkien's dragons tend to be sinuous, serpentine creatures, having the appearance almost of a winged snake rather than the more traditional dragon-form. This would explain the term 'long-worm' easily. It's interesting to note that Tolkien gave this form to another northern dragon, Smaug, which strongly suggests that he, too, was one of the long-worms.
 It should be noted that Tolkien doesn't conclusively refer to long-worms as a 'type' of dragon, and it is just possible that 'long-worm' is simply another word for 'dragon'. This doesn't seem very likely, though: if all worms are long, why call them 'long-worms'? Of course, if we assume that long-worms are a 'subspecies' of dragon, there must be other, less long, types.


* Longbeards
A name for Durin's Folk.
 One of the seven clans of the Dwarves, those that followed the oldest of the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves, Durin the Deathless. This people is more commonly known as Durin's Folk.


* Longbottom
The birthplace of pipe-weed in the Shire.
 A village or town in the Southfarthing of the Shire. Its name means 'long valley', and we know that the village and its surroundings were sheltered from the elements, probably by the valley's sides.
 Longbottom entered history in about III 2670 (1070 by the Shire-reckoning), when a certain Tobold Hornblower introduced a new herb there. The valley's sheltered aspect, and the relatively warm climate of the Southfarthing, made the region around Longbottom ideal for growing this new plant, pipe-weed, which rapidly became the centre of a thriving industry. Longbottom Leaf remained one of the most famous varieties of the weed.


* Longbottom Leaf
One of the finest varieties of pipe-weed.
 One of the three varieties of pipe-weed recorded as being the most sought-after, the other two being Old Toby and Southern Star. Longbottom in the Southfarthing was the first place in the Shire where pipe-weed was grown, and so Longbottom Leaf must have been one of the oldest and most established types (if not the original variety). The first Leaf-grower was Tobold Hornblower, and his family continued the tradition. When Merry and Pippin found barrels of Longbottom Leaf in the ruins of Isengard, they bore the brand-marks of the Hornblower family.


* Longholes
A common family name among the Bree-hobbits.


* Longo Baggins
An uncle of Bilbo Baggins, Longo founded the Sackville-Baggins family when he married Camellia Sackville. Otho Sackville-Baggins was their son.

* Lord of And?i?Lord of Andunie
Title of the ancestors of Elendil.
 The title of the lords of the shoreland region of And?i?in western N?enor; descended from Tar-Elendil, the fourth King of N?enor, and ancestors of the Kings of Gondor and of Arnor.


* Lord of Balrogs
A title of Gothmog, greatest of the Balrogs and High-captain of Angband. He fought in the Dagor-nuin-Giliath (where he mortally wounded F?nor) and the Nirnaeth Arnoediad (where he slew High King Fingon with an axe). He met his doom in the Fall of Gondolin, where he fought Ecthelion of the Fountain in the Square of the King, though Ecthelion also fell in that combat.
 It is nowhere stated for certain how many Balrogs Gothmog had at his command, but the number seems to have been small; Morgoth had no more than seven of these Demons of Fire in his service.


* Lord of Dale
The ancestors and descendants of Girion.
 The hereditary ruler of the township of Dale. The first recorded Lord was Girion, who was slain by Smaug when he descended on Erebor. Girion's descendant, Bard I, avenged his ancestor by slaying Smaug, and refounding Dale.


* Lord of Dol Amroth
Title of the descendants of Galador.
 A title of the Princes of Dol Amroth, who ruled the Gondorian lands of Belfalas from their castle on the headland of Dol Amroth. They were descended from Galador the first Prince, and at the time of the War of the Ring, the Lordship was held by Imrahil son of Adrahil.

-----

* Lord of Eagles|Lord of the Eagles
Greatest of the birds of Middle-earth.
 The title of the chief Eagle of Middle-earth. In the First Age, this was Thorondor, while in the Third, the title seems to have been held by Gwaihir.


* Lord of Emyn Arnen
A title of Steward Faramir.
 A title given to Faramir by Aragorn Elessar, who granted him the hills of Emyn Arnen for his residence as Prince of Ithilien, Gondor's lands east of the Great River.


* Lord of Eregion
A title given to Celebrimbor, grandson of F?nor.
 Celebrimbor was the son of Curufin, who was in turn the son of F?nor himself. He became the greatest of the M?dain, the Jewel-smiths of Eregion, and was acknowledged as their leader and lord.
 It is not certain whether Celebrimbor was the Lord of Eregion throughout its history. The references to him in The Lord of the Rings seem to suggest this, but other materials in Unfinished Tales hint that Eregion might in fact have been founded by Galadriel and Celeborn, with Celebrimbor only becoming its lord later in its history. This seems to be a point on which Tolkien changed his mind: the title 'Lord of Eregion' only appeared with the revised edition of The Lord of the Rings.


* Lord of Forests
Tauron, a title for Orom?
 The literal meaning of the name Tauron, a title used for Orom? the Huntsman of the Valar.

* Lord of Lossarnach
Ruler of the vales south of Minas Tirith.
 The lord of the flowered vales of the White Mountains that lay to the south and west of Minas Tirith. Almost nothing is known of the history and descent of this title, except the name of its holder during the War of the Ring. That was Forlong the Fat, who rode to Minas Tirith with two hundred men from his homeland, and fell in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. Whether Forlong left an heir to inherit his lordship is unknown.


* Lord of Minas Tirith
A title of Kings and Stewards.
 Strictly a title of any of the rulers of Gondor, but used most often of the Stewards who ruled in place of the King during the latter part of the Third Age.

 One of the many titles of Sauron, the second Dark Lord and master of the Black Land of Mordor.


* Lord of Morgul

* Lord of the Glittering Caves
A title of Gimli.

There they founded a colony, and Gimli became known as the Lord of the Glittering Caves. His Dwarves performed great services for the Rohirrim and the Men of Gondor, of which the most famous was the making of new gates for Minas Tirith, forged out of mithril and steel.


* Lord of the Mark
A title of the King of Rohan.
 A common alternative title for the King of Rohan, probably the favoured style of address among the Rohirrim themselves.


* Lord of the Nazg?|Lord of the Nazgul|Chieftain of the Ringwraiths|Chieftain of the Ring-wraiths
Dread Servant of the Dark Lord.
 Mightiest of the Nazg?, the Nine Servants of Sauron. He destroyed the North-kingdom from his realm of Angmar during the mid-Third Age. He was slain by ?wyn and Meriadoc Brandybuck during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.

"The Lord of the Ring is not Frodo, but the master of the Dark Tower of Mordor, whose power is again stretching out over the world!"
(Words of Gandalf; from The Fellowship of the Ring II 1, Many Meetings)
-----
A rare title for Sauron, the master of the One Ring. In fact, it occurs only once in The Lord of the Rings: in Rivendell, Pippin wrongly granted the title to Frodo, but was quickly corrected by Gandalf with the words shown above.


* Lord of the Rings
Most famous of Sauron's titles.
 A title given to Sauron, the deviser of the Great Rings, and maker of the Ruling Ring in Orodruin.
 Curiously, given that this title gives its name to The Lord of the Rings, it is in fact very rare, and only appears twice in the entire book. Because of this, we can only speculate on exactly which rings it refers to. Gandalf's use of the phrase 'the Nine Servants of the Lord of the Rings' suggests that he intends specifically the Nine Rings of the Nazg?. The title may not have been meant to include the Three Rings of the Elves, in whose making Sauron was said to have had no part (although they too fell under his control when he wore the One Ring).


* Lord of the West
A title given to the Valar.
 A title used for any of the great Valar, and especially Manw? The twentieth King of N?enor, Ar-Ad?akh?, attempted to usurp this title - it is the meaning of his name.

* L?ien (in Middle-earth)|L?ien|Lorien|Glornan|Laurenand?Laurenande|Nan Laur
The land of the Galadhrim between Celebrant and Anduin, ruled by Celeborn and Galadriel. Probably the original name of this land was altered to the form of the Quenya name L?ien of the gardens of the Vala Irmo in Valinor.
 Nandorin L?inand (Quenya Laurenand? Sindarin Glornan, Nan Laur), derived from older Lind?inand 'Vale of the Land of Singers'; Laurelind?inan 'Valley of Singing Gold'. In Lothl?ien the Sindarin word loth 'flower' is prefixed. See also Dwimordene, Lothl?ien.

-----

* L?hien Tin?iel|L?hien|Luthien
The daughter of King Thingol and Melian the Maia, who after the fulfilment of the Quest of the Silmaril and the death of Beren chose to become mortal and to share his fate. Called Tin?iel 'Nightingale'.
-----
The Nightingale of Doriath.
 The only daughter of King Thingol of Doriath and Melian the Maia, and said to be the fairest Elf to have ever lived. She was discovered by Beren as he wandered the woods of her father's kingdom, and they grew to love one another. When L?hien took Beren before her father, he was apalled that his royal daughter should wish to wed a mortal, and so set Beren what he thought was an unachievable task, to recover a Silmaril from the Iron Crown of Morgoth himself. So Beren left Doriath in pursuit of his hopeless quest.
 After a time, a darkness fell on L?hien's heart, and she learned from her mother Melian what this meant; Beren had been captured by Sauron, and was held in the dungeons of Tol-in-Gaurhoth. Though Thingol sought to stop her, L?hien set out from Doriath to rescue Beren, if she could. Passing through many adventures, she gained the help of Huan the Hound, and together they came to Sauron's Isle. Through L?hien's magic and Huan's strength they defeated Sauron and rescued Beren. Eventually Beren set out for Angband once again, and L?hien accompanied him.
 Through L?hien's powers, they passed the gates of Angband, and the great wolf Carcharoth that guarded them. Coming before the Dark Throne itself, she wove a spell that put Morgoth and his court into a deep sleep, and Beren cut a Silmaril from the Iron Crown. Returning to the gates, they found that Carcharoth barred their escape. Beren held up the hallowed Jewel to protect them, but the monstrous wolf bit off his hand, and with it consumed the Silmaril. But the Silmarils were blessed by Varda herself, so that any unclean flesh that touched them would be withered and burnt. The wolf's innards were consumed with that burning, and it ran howling into the south.
 L?hien healed Beren, and they came at last back to her father's halls at Menegroth. There they heard tidings that the maddened wolf had entered Thingol's realm, and Beren set out with the King to the Hunting of the Wolf. After nightfall they returned; the wolf was slain and the Silmaril recovered, but Beren was wounded mortally. So he passed away, and soon after L?hien too wasted of grief.
 Their spirits were gathered in the Halls of Mandos in the Uttermost West of the World, and there L?hien sang a song of such extraordinary power and beauty that it moved even the implacable heart of Mandos himself. So she was granted a unique fate, to become mortal and return to Middle-earth with Beren, where they dwelt for a time in happiness on the green island of Tol Galen in the River Adurant.


* Mablung (Elf)|Mablung

* Maedhros
The eldest son of F?nor, called the Tall; rescued by Fingon from Thangorodrim; held the Hill of Himring and the lands about; formed the Union of Maedhros that ended in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad; bore one of the Silmarils with him to his death at the end of the First Age.
-----
The eldest of the Seven Sons of F?nor, and considered to be their leader. In Valinor he swore the Oath of F?nor, and followed his father back to Middle-earth, though of all F?nor's sons, except perhaps Maglor, he regretted this the most.
 After F?nor's death, Morgoth captured Maedhros through trickery, and hung him by the wrist from the heights of Thangorodrim. Fingon succeeded in rescuing him, but he lost his right hand in their escape.
 With his brothers, Maedhros held the eastern passes into Beleriand; he himself dwelt in a fortress on the hill of Himring. He worked to unite the Houses of the Noldor, and formed the Union of Maedhros, but that Union perished in the disaster of the Nirnaeth Arnoediad.
 After the defeat of Morgoth in the War of Wrath, Maedhros and his brother Maglor stole the two remaining Silmarils from the camp of the Valar, but the hallowed jewels would not suffer the brothers to hold them. In torment, Maedhros cast himself into a fissure in the earth.


* Maeglin
'Sharp Glance', son of E? and Aredhel Turgon's sister, born in Nan Elmoth; became mighty in Gondolin, and betrayed it to Morgoth; slain in the sack of the city by Tuor. See L?ion.
-----
The betrayer of Gondolin.
 The son of E? and Aredhel Ar-Feiniel; he escaped his father's halls in Nan Elmoth with his mother, and came with her to Gondolin. Many years later, he was captured by the spies of Morgoth and betrayed the city.


* Maglor
The second son of F?nor, a great singer and minstrel; held the lands called Maglor's Gap; at the end of the First Age seized with Maedhros the two Silmarils that remained in Middle-earth, and cast the one that he took into the Sea.
-----
The second son of F?nor, who inherited more of his mother Nerdanel's gentle spirit than any of his brothers. Maglor was famed as a poet and bard, but he took the Oath of F?nor in Tirion and shared in the woes that came of it.
 Maglor followed his father into exile, and saw him perish at the hands of the Balrogs. With the rest of his brothers, he dwelt to the east of Beleriand, and Maglor settled between the Little Gelion and Greater Gelion, the two rivers that came together to form the long Gelion itself. That region - which came to be known as Maglor's Gap - lacked hills or mountains, and so was the place on Beleriand's border that was most open to attack from the north.
 Maglor guarded his Gap for four and a half centuries, but was eventually overcome in the Dagor Bragollach. The dragon Glaurung invaded Maglor's land and ruined it, so that he was forced to flee to the fortress of his brother Maedhros on the hill of Himring to the west. Sixteen years later, he marched out with Maedhros to the great battle that should have seen the revenge of the Elves on Morgoth, but was brought to ruin by the treachery of Uldor the Accursed. Maglor slew Uldor himself, but the field was lost; that was the battle afterwards called the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, the Unnumbered Tears.
 All seven of F?nor's sons survived the Nirnaeth. In the years that followed, one of the three Silmarils was recovered from Morgoth's crown, and came eventually to be held by Dior in Doriath. He would not surrender it to the brothers' claims, and so they assaulted Thingol's ancient kingdom. Celegorm, Caranthir and Curufin all fell in that futile battle. Now only four of F?nor's sons survived; Maglor, the eldest son Maedhros, and the two youngest brothers Amrod and Amras. After some years had passed, these four came to learn that a Silmaril was held by Elwing at the Mouths of Sirion, and though they restrained themselves for some time, their Oath compelled them to take back the Jewel. So they assaulted their fellow Elves, and Elwing escaped with the Silmaril across the Sea to her husband E?endil, and together they sailed into the West. That voyage would in time bring about the downfall of Morgoth.
 After the destruction of Morgoth, the last two Silmarils were recovered from his Crown. By this time, only Maedhros and Maglor remained of F?nor's sons, and Maglor came close to repenting the Oath. Wearily, he accompanied his brother in the theft of the Silmarils, but their evil deeds in recovering them meant that the holy Jewels burned their skin. Maedhros in despair leapt into a fiery fissure, and Maglor, the last of the Sons of F?nor to survive, cast his Silmaril into the Sea. Legend says that he still wanders the shores of the World, singing laments for his despair and regret.

* Mahtan

* Maiar|Maia
Ainur of lesser degree than the Valar (singular Maia).
-----
Lesser Ainur of Arda.
 Of the many spirits that descended into Arda at its beginning, those of lesser stature than the Valar, though they were still powerful, were known as Maiar. Each of the Maiar was attached to the 'people' of a particular Vala. So, for example, the Maia Oss? as a spirit of the sea, belonged to the people of Ulmo, while Curumo, the Maia who came to Middle-earth as Saruman, belonged to the people of Aul?the Smith.
 In the Third Age, there were still Maiar in physical form to be found in Middle-earth. The most important of these were Saruman, Sauron (originally also of Aul?s people), and Ol?in, known as Gandalf, who belonged to the people of Manw?and Varda.


* Malach Aradan|Malach
Son of Marach; given the Elvish name Aradan.
-----

-----
A mysterious lord of L?ien.
 The King of L?ien who ruled before Amroth, and died in the War of the Last Alliance on the field of Dagorlad. According to most sources, this King was Amd?, Amroth's father, but one source gives instead the mysterious name of Malgalad, nowhere else mentioned.


* Malinalda
'Tree of Gold', a name of Laurelin.


* Malinorn?Malinorne|Malinorni
Quenya form of Sindarin mallorn; plural malinorni.


* Mallor
The third King of Arthedain.
 The son of Beleg and grandson of Amlaith of Fornost, the founder of Arthedain. He became King of that realm at the age of 134, and ruled during troubled times. It was during Mallor's reign, or perhaps during the last years of his father Beleg, that the Istari - the Wizards - arrived in the north of Middle-earth. They came soon after the shadow had fallen on Greenwood the Great, and it was near the end of Mallor's rule that they discovered its source at Dol Guldur. At this time, though, even the Wise did not suspect that it might be Sauron returned.
 The meaning of Mallor's name isn't known with certainty, but it seems to contain elements relating to gold. We might speculate, then, that Mallor was one of the wealthier Kings of Arthedain. Apart from the growing menace of Mirkwood, his reign was free of warfare or strife.
 Mallor ruled Arthedain for eighty-one years, and was succeeded by his son Celepharn.


* Mallorn|Mellyrn|Mallorns
Name of the great trees with golden flowers brought from Tol Eress? to Eldalond?in N?enor, and afterwards grown in Lothl?ien. Quenya malinorn?
-----
The golden trees of L?ien.

* Malva Headstrong
A matriarch of the Brandybuck family.
 A famous and important Hobbit. She wedded Gormadoc Brandybuck about two hundred and fifty years before the War of the Ring, and was the ancestor of all the Brandybucks, including Merry, who appear in The Lord of the Rings.


* Malvegil
The sixth King of Arthedain.
 Malvegil son of Celebrindor is best known for the fact that the Witch-king founded the realm of Angmar during his reign. Nearly seven hundred years after its foundation, Angmar and its allies would destroy his kingdom of Arthedain, but in Malvegil's time there is no record of any open warfare between the two nations.
 Nonetheless, the emergence of Angmar saw evil things multiply in the eastern lands, driving a westward migration across Eriador. Notable among those travelling out of the east were the Hobbits, and it was during Malvegil's time as King that the main Hobbit settlement in Bree took place.
 Malvegil ruled Arthedain for seventy-seven years, and was succeeded by his son, Argeleb I.


* M?andil|Mamandil
Name given to himself by Hallacar in his first encounters with Ancalim?


* Man of the West
The meaning of D?adan.
-----
"'The D?adan,' said Bilbo. 'He is often called that here. But I thought you knew enough Elvish at least to know d?-adan: Man of the West, N?enorean.'"
(Words of Bilbo to Frodo in Rivendell; The Fellowship of the Ring II 1, Many Meetings)
-----
The literal translation of the word D?adan, a word that could in principle be applied to any of the N?en?eans or their descendants. The plural form is D?edain, 'Men of the West'.
 In Rivendell, it seems to have been specially reserved as a term of address for Aragorn, whose ancestral line stretched back through Isildur and Elendil to the first Kings of N?enor and beyond. As the rightful lord of all the D?edain in Middle-earth, he was indeed - as Bilbo put it - the D?adan.

* Mearas|Mearh
The horses of Rohan.
-----
Noblest of the horses of Rohan.
 In the old north of Middle-earth lived a proud race of wild horses, long-lived, wise and fleet of foot. The legends of Men said that their ancestors had been brought from the West by B?a, their name for the Vala Orom?
 One of these was captured as a foal by L?d of the ?th?d. It grew into a strong white horse, but when L?d tried to mount it, it threw him and killed him. L?d's son Eorl took the horse himself, naming him Felar?. Felar? was one of the greatest horses to have ever lived, and was said to understand the speech of Men. He carried Eorl when the ?th?d rode south to Rohan, and there sired a race of horses nearly as great as himself.
 These were the Mearas, noble horses that lived as long as a Man, and had extraordinary strength and intelligence. Throughout their history, they would only allow themselves to be ridden by the Lord of the Mark or his sons. This long tradition was broken by Gandalf, who managed to train the greatest of the Mearas of his time, Shadowfax, and rode that mighty horse throughout the War of the Ring.
 The word Mearas comes from an Anglo-Saxon word meaning simply 'horses'. Its singular form would be mearh, but no character in The Lord of the Rings ever uses that word.


* Meduseld
The Golden Hall of Edoras, in which the Kings of Rohan dwelt and held their court.


* Melian
A Maia, who left Valinor and came to Middle-earth; afterwards the Queen of King Thingol in Doriath, about which she set a girdle of enchantment, the Girdle of Melian; mother of L?hien, and foremother of Elrond and Elros.
-----
Queen to Thingol of Doriath.
 In Valinor, Melian dwelt in the gardens of L?ien, but she journeyed often to Middle-earth. There, in the woods of Nan Elmoth, she came upon Elw?Singollo (Elu Thingol) as he marched into the West with the people of the Teleri. Many of his people remained in Beleriand searching for their lord (these were to become the Sindar), but through the enchantment of Melian, he remained hidden from them.
 At last, Melian and Thingol came forth from Nan Elmoth and founded the kingdom of Doriath, which Melian protected from the hosts of Morgoth through her powers. She encircled the land in the Girdle of Melian, which none could pass without her wishing it.
 Melian and Thingol ruled in Doriath for many centuries, but when at last Thingol was slain by treacherous Dwarves, Melian departed from the halls of Menegroth and returned across the Great Sea to Valinor.


* Melilot Brandybuck
Dancer of the Springle-ring.
 A distant cousin of both Meriadoc Brandybuck and Frodo Baggins. She was present at Bilbo's Birthday Party in III 3001, when she was just sixteen years old. The only part she played in the great events of that time was to dance the springle-ring at the party with Everard Took.


* Melkor|Belegur|Belegurth
The Quenya name for the great rebellious Vala, the beginning of evil, in his origin the mightiest of the Ainur; afterwards named Morgoth, Bauglir, the Dark Lord, the Enemy, etc. The meaning of Melkor was 'He who arises in Might'; the Sindarin form was Belegur, but it was never used, save in a deliberately altered form Belegurth 'Great Death'.
-----
Mightiest of the Dwellers in Arda.
 Said to be the mightiest dweller in Arda, Melkor was of the same order of the Valar and equal in power to Manw?himself, who was Melkor's brother in the mind of Il?atar. While the Valar descended into Arda to order and govern wisely, though, Melkor sought power for himself alone, and sought to bend all things to his own will.
 All that the Valar made, Melkor looked to destroy; long before the Elves awoke, he threw down the Lamps of the Valar, destroying their dwelling in Almaren. They removed to Valinor, and fearing for the coming Elves, made war on Melkor and imprisoned him for three ages. By the time he was released, the Elves had come to Valinor; Melkor turned back to his evil ways; slaying Finw?and stealing the Silmarils, he destroyed the Two Trees of Valinor and fled back to his ancient fortress of Angband in the north of Middle-earth.


* Men|Man
The Afterborn Children of Il?atar.
 The youngest of the races of Arda (with the possible exception of Hobbits), the first Men awoke in the far eastern land of Hild?ien as the Sun first rose in the west and the Noldor returned from Valinor. Seeing the sunrise, many of the first Men set out westwards, and so came eventually to Beleriand after some three hundred years of wandering.
 Men are unique in possessing the Gift of Men, Death, by which they leave the world after an allotted time and go beyond it.


* Men of Bree|Man of Bree
The nearest settled Men to the Shire.
 In the hard years of the Second Age, a race of Men inhabited the White Mountains far to the south of the Shire, in the land that would one day become Rohan. Groups of these mountaineers began to migrate northwards. Some settled in the region that became Dunland, but others travelled farther still, and coming to a tall wooded hill not far from the ancient Barrow-downs, they founded a settlement that took its name from the hill, Bree.
 In appearance, these Men had brown hair, and in stature were short and broad. They seem to have maintained a curious tradition of taking their names from plants and herbs, and many of these surnames are recorded; Appledore, Ferny, Goatleaf, Heathertoes, Rushlight and Thistlewool. Butterbur was another of these plant-names, an important one in Bree, for it was the ancestral name of the keepers of the Prancing Pony inn.
 Though Bree seems to have been founded before the beginning of the Third Age, it lay on the road between the North- and South-kingdoms of the D?edain, and so was drawn into the history of that Age. When the North-kingdom of Arnor was founded, Bree lay within its borders, and the Men of Bree became subjects of that country. More than a thousand years later, in about III 1300, members of a strange and little-known race began to appear in the township. Man-like in appearance, but much smaller, these were Hobbits fleeing the encroaching darkness to the east. Many of them stayed among the Men, and a unique society arose where the Big People and the Little People lived beside one another in harmony.

* Men of Minas Tirith|Man of Minas Tirith
The people of Gondor's capital.
 The population of Minas Tirith, the seat of the later Kings and Stewards of Gondor and, for much of the Third Age, the greatest city in the known regions of Middle-earth. The Men of Minas Tirith were descended in part from the N?en?eans of old, and they retained some of the vigour and long life of that people, especially in their royal line.

* Meneldil
Son of An?ion and third King of Gondor.
-----
Royal grandson of Elendil.
 The son of An?ion and grandson of Elendil, the first King of Gondor to rule in his own name. He was succeeded by his son Cemendur.
-----
Meneldil's Early Life: Of Meneldil's life before the War of the Last Alliance we know almost nothing, but it is possible to deduce some of the most important incidents in that time. He was born in the very last years of N?enor, and was at most twenty years old at the time of the Downfall. He would have seen the drowning of the island with his own eyes, from the deck of one of his father's ships, and then was propelled by the rushing water to the shores of Middle-earth.
 What part he took in the building of the Realms in Exile is a mystery. During this time, he would have been considereda relatively minor nobleman. As the fourth child of Elendil's younger son, he was at best seventh in line to the succession, and the prospect of his becoming King was remote. After more than a century, Sauron rose again in the east, triggering the great events of the War of the Last Alliance. It is to be presumed that Meneldil played his part in that War - a war in which he lost his father An?ion - but we have no specific details of his deeds.
-----
The Year of Transition, III 1 - III 2: Before the War, Elendil had sat has the High King in the northern realm of Arnor, while Isildur and An?ion had ruled Gondor jointly in his name. Since both Elendil and An?ion had been lost in the War, these arrangements needed to be changed. Isildur inherited the High Kingship, and he placed the rule of Gondor in the hands of his brother's eldest eligible son, Meneldil.
 Before departing for the North, Isildur spent a year ordering matters in the Gondor, and instructing Meneldil in his new duties. During this year, Isildur and Meneldil journeyed around the borderlands of the South-kingdom, defining its bounds. It was while returning from their travels that they came upon Amon Anwar, the Halifirien,which at that time stood almost at the central point of the country. Isildur chose that hill as the resting place of his father's remains, and the Tomb of Elendil that he placed there was to last long after Meneldil's line had failed.
 It was the beginning of Yavanni?when Isildur set out from Osgiliath, leaving the South-kingdom in Meneldil's hands. We are told that Meneldil was notdisappointed to see the High King and his sons leave for the North, and that he hoped to rule Gondor himself for a long time. Far-sighted as he was, though, even Meneldil couldn't haveforeseen the events that were to unfold. A month after setting out, Isildur was set upon by Orcs and killed, together with his three elder sons. The Kingship in the North fell on Isildur's only surviving son, eleven-year-old Valandil. This unexpected turn of events transformed Meneldil from a mere caretaker into the true King of Gondor.
-----
The Rule of Gondor, III 2 - III 158: After the upheavals of III 2, Meneldil was to rule Gondor for many years,but during this period he effectively disappears from history. With Sauron utterly defeated, his reign was a peaceful andquiet one. The only historical events recorded during this time are the wedding of Elrond to Celebr?n, and the birth of their twin sons Elladan and Elrohir. These would have been important events in the North, but we cannot be sure if the Gondorians were even aware of them.
 Meneldil ruled in Gondor for one hundred and fifty-six years, and was succeeded by his son Cemendur.


* Menelmacar
'Swordsman of the Sky', the constellation Orion.
-----

* Meneltarma|The Pillar
'Pillar of Heavens', the mountain in the midst of N?enor, on whose summit was the Hallow of Eru Il?atar. Called also the Holy Mountain of the N?en?eans, the Hallowed Mountain of the N?en?eans.
-----
The Pillar of Heaven, the isolated peak at the centre of the island of N?enor, on which the N?en?eans gave thanks to Eru. The Meneltarma was said by some to have survived the Downfall, and remained as an island in the Great Sea.


* Menelvagor
The Swordsman of the Sky.
-----
"... and there leaned up, as he climbed over the rim of the world, the Swordsman of the Sky, Menelvagor with his shining belt. The Elves all burst into song."
(From The Fellowship of the Ring I 3, Three is Company)
-----
Name given by the Elves of Middle-earth to the bright and prominent star-group that we know today as Orion.
 The stars of Menelvagor were originally given their shape in the sky by Varda, who in Middle-earth has the name Elbereth, 'Star-lady'. In an ancient time when Melkor still lurked in Utumno, she used the stars to fill the sky with symbols of watchfulness and guardianship. Together with the Valacirca, Menelvagor was one of the two most important of these.

-----
The Mortal Lands of Arda.
 The great continent on which much of the Silmarillion, and the adventures of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, are set. Little is known of the East and South of Middle-earth, or of the far north, but the geography and history of its Western lands are chronicled in great detail.
-----
Ancient Times: The foundations of Middle-earth were laid by Aul?in times ancient beyond reckoning, and the Valar lit the new lands with two great Lamps, Illuin in the north and Ormal in the south. From fear of Tulkas, Melkor had fled beyond the Walls of the World, and Middle-earth was a place of peace and beauty. The Valar themselves dwelt in its central regions, on the green island of Almaren. This was the time known as the Spring of Arda.
 Unknown to the Valar, though, Melkor secretly returned, and delved his first great fortress of Utumno in the mountains of the far distant north. When he judged the time was right, he assailed Almaren and, surprising the Valar, destroyed their habitation in Middle-earth. Fleeing back to Utumno, he saved himself from the wrath of Tulkas. This is one of the great disasters of Middle-earth's history: the Valar departed forever, and left Middle-earth under the sole control of Melkor, who claimed it as his own.
 Though the Valar made a new home for themselves in Aman, and lit their new land of Valinor with the light of the Two Trees, Middle-earth was now left in darkness for many Ages. The Valar did not completely forget their ancient home, though, and Yavanna and Orom? especially, came there from time to time to try and mend the hurts of Melkor if they could.
 It was at this time, too, that Aul?returned, and secretly fashioned a hall beneath the mountains of Middle-earth. It was there that he wrought the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves, who were given life by Il?atar, and set to sleep until the awakening of the Firstborn.
 Despite these brief visits from the Valar, though, Middle-earth was effectively controlled by Melkor, who was free to act as he would. Slowly, his polluted realm spread southwards over Middle-earth.
-----
The Coming of the Elves: The Awakening of the Elves at Cuivi?en brought about profound changes in Middle-earth. At first they lived in darkness, prey to the creatures of Melkor, but Orom?found them, and the Valar decided to act: they went to war against Melkor.
 There followed the Battle of the Powers, in the north and west of Middle-earth. That war rent and twisted the lands, giving them the shape they were to keep until the War of Wrath at the end of the First Age. Dorthonion and the highlands north of Beleriand were raised up at that time, and many bays, including the Bay of Balar, were created.
 Melkor was ultimately defeated, and taken as a prisoner back to Valinor. After much debate, the Valar also offered the Elves a home in Aman, and many accepted. Led by Orom? the Vanyar, Noldor and Teleri made the Great Journey across Middle-earth from the far east where they awoke to its western shores.
 Many of these departed Middle-earth across the Sea, but some remained, of which the major groups were the Sindar of Beleriand and the Nandor of the Anduin valley. Other groups, mainly of Telerin origin, had also left the Journey: these were the people who were to become known as the Silvan Elves. Also, in the far east, remained the Elves who had refused the summons of the Valar, the Avari. All these kinds together are known as the Moriquendi, the Dark Elves, for they did not go to Valinor or see the light of the Two Trees.

* Mighty of the West
A possible title of the N?en?eans.
-----
"... in that hour he appeared as one of the Mighty of the West, and fit to be the father of the kings of the Kings of Men..."
(Unfinished Tales of N?enor and Middle-earth I 1, Of Tuor and his Coming to Gondolin)
-----
A title used once, in the quotation given above, to refer to Tuor the son of Huor. Its exact meaning is ambiguous: it appears in a passage that discusses Tuor's relationship with his descendants, the N?en?eans, and so we have treated it here as an epithet for that division of Mankind.
 It might conceivably, though, refer to the Valar, though it seems unlikely that such a comparison would be made of a mortal Man.


* M?|Mim
The Petty-dwarf, in whose house (Bar-en-Danwedh) on Amon R?h T?in dwelt with the outlaw band, and by whom their lair was betrayed to the Orcs; slain by H?in in Nargothrond.

* Minalcar
The Gondorian noble who became R?endacil II.
 Hyarmendacil I was a mighty King, and his reign during the ninth and tenth centuries of the Third Age saw Gondor grow into a huge and powerful kingdom, stretching east to the Sea of Rh?, and south to Umbar. Hyarmendacil's immediate descendants were not so vigorous. His son Atanatar, and grandsons Narmacil and Calmacil, were content to live a life of ease in the splendour of Gondor's royal courts.
 Fortunately, Hyarmendacil's great-grandson Minalcar inherited more of his forefather's strength of mind. Born in the last years of Hyarmendacil's long reign, Minalcar became active in matters political and military, to the extent that, not long after his uncle Narmacil became King, he handed effective control of the South-kingdom to his nephew. Minalcar took up the challenge, and managed to rebuild some of the power that Gondor had lost in the reigns of his grandfather Atanatar and uncle Narmacil. In particular, Gondor's eastern borders had become victim to Easterling incursions. Minalcar built a great army and wiped out the invaders from the lands west of the Sea of Rh?.
 It was from this event that he took the name R?endacil 'Victor in the East'. After Narmacil's heirless death, and a brief reign by his own father Calmacil, Minalcar finally ascended the throne to take up the true Kingship of Gondor, to be known to history by the name R?endacil II.


* Minardil
Twenty-fifth King of Gondor.
-----
Successor to Hyarmendacil II.
 The son of Hyarmendacil II of Gondor, King Minardil had two sons, Telemnar and Minastan. He had reigned for just thirteen years when he was attacked at Pelargir by the Corsairs of Umbar, and slain. He was succeeded by Telemnar, who himself died with all his children in the Dark Plague just two years later. Ultimately, the throne was taken by Tarondor, the son of Minardil's second son Minastan. Minardil is perhaps best known as being served by Steward H?in of Emyn Arnen, the ancestor of the later Ruling Stewards.

* Minas Tirith (in Beleriand)|Minas Tirith
'Tower of Watch', built by Finrod Felagund on Tol Sirion; see Tol-in-Gaurhoth. Also called Minas of King Finrod.
-----
The tower that guarded the Pass of Sirion.
 The tower that guarded the Pass of Sirion, after which Minas Tirith in Gondor was perhaps named. Built by Finrod Felagund to keep watch on the western pass of Beleriand, it was mainly in the keeping of his brother Orodreth until captured by Sauron in the late First Age.
 The name means 'Tower of Guard'.
 Sauron didn't destroy the tower after its capture - instead, he ruled it himself as Tol-in-Gaurhoth for a period of about ten years. The tower was finally destroyed by L?hien during the Quest of the Silmaril.


* Minas Tirith (in Gondor)|Minas Tirith
Later name of Minas Anor. Called the City of Gondor.
-----
Gondor's Tower of Guard.
 The seven-tiered citadel of the Kings of Gondor, originally named Minas Anor. After the destruction of Osgiliath, Minas Tirith became the seat of power in the South-kingdom.
 'Minas Tirith' was the name given to this city after the capture of Minas Ithil by the Nazg? in III 2002. The city itself, though, was much older - as Minas Anor, it had stood since the late Second Age, and was some 2,100 years old when it was renamed. For its origins and earlier history, refer to the entry for Minas Anor.


* Minastan
Ancestor of the later Kings of Gondor.
 The second son of King Minardil of Gondor. His elder brother Telemnar had sat on their father's throne for just two years when he died with all his heirs in the Great Plague.

 The long river that rose in the icy north of Middle-earth, in the Misty Mountains about a hundred miles north of Rivendell. It flowed southwestwards through the lands that had once been held by the kingdom of Rhudaur, round the woodland region of the Trollshaws. Passing beneath the Last Bridge on the East-West Road, it flowed on into the south, until it met the Glanduin above Tharbad to form the River Gwathl?(or Greyflood).
 The river's Mannish name was Hoarwell, a free translation of the Elvish Mitheithel. The Elvish name for the river contains the components mith 'grey' and eithel 'spring, well'.

Mithrellas, it is said, became lost in the woods of Belfalas, where she was found by Imraz? the N?en?ean. So Elvish blood entered the line of the Princes of Dol Amroth, it was claimed, since her son Galador was the first of the long line of Princes.


* Mithril|Moria-silver|Truesilver
The metal known as 'Moria-silver', found also in N?enor.
-----
Most precious of metals.
 Also called 'truesilver', and many other names besides; the remarkable metal that the Dwarves discovered in the mines of Khazad-d?. It was supple and easy to work, and could be polished to shimmer like silver that never tarnished, and it was as strong as steel. In Middle-earth, mithril was found nowhere but the Dwarf-mines of Khazad-d?, though there are indications that it was also found in N?enor and in Aman.
 The metal held a value almost beyond price. In N?enor, King Tar-Telemmait?became so greedy for mithril that it gave him his name - Telemmait?means 'silverhand'. In Middle-earth, meanwhile, the Dwarves' discovery of mithril drew the Noldor to found the kingdom of Eregion in the lands west of their mines. As the years passed, the seams beneath Khazad-d? began to be worked out, and the Dwarves dug deeper and deeper. It was their deep mining for mithril that would awake the Balrog, Durin's Bane, and bring about the downfall of their kingdom.
 Of all the mithril artefacts, the most famous is surely the coat of mail given to Bilbo Baggins by Thorin Oakenshield, that was held for a while in the Michel Delving mathom-house before being worn by Frodo during the Quest of Mount Doom. Many other of the World's most important items were made of mithril, too. The symbol of High Kingship worn by Elendil and Isildur was the Elendilmir, a diamond bound to the brow by a mithril fillet, and Nenya, one of the Three Rings of the Elves, was also made of the metal, again bearing a diamond. Greatest of all, according to legend, was the ship of E?endil in which he sailed into the sky, making the gleam of truesilver visible to the world as the Evening and Morning Star.


* Mithrim (lake)|Mithrim
The name of the great lake in the east of Hithlum.

 A pastoral region of grassland and pasture that lay in the central parts of the island of N?enor. The borders of the Mittalmar formed a roughly oval region, two hundred and fifty miles west to east, and one hundred and seventy north to south. Near its centre rose a single tall mountain, the famous Meneltarma, the Pillar of Heaven. The two main rivers of N?enor had their springs in this region, the Nunduin?that flowed westward, and the Siril that flowed south.
 The eastern part of the Mittalmar was the most important region on the whole island. This was Arandor, the Kingsland, where the royal city of Armenelos stood, as well as the bustling eastern port of R?enna. A road ran between these two cities, and carried on westward across the Mittalmar and into the western parts of the island.


* Moon-letters
The secret runes of the Dwarves.
-----
"'Moon-letters are rune-letters, but you cannot see them,' said Elrond, 'not when you look straight at them.'"
(The Hobbit 3, A Short Rest)
-----
A system of writing invented by Dwarves. Moon-letters were ordinary runes, but written in such a way that they could only be read when the light of the moon shone behind the writing. Some moon-letters could be read by any moonlight, but it was possible to make the writing even more secret. More sophisticated moon-letters could only be read by the same shape of moon, or at the same time of year, as when they were written.
 Moon-letters were written with silver pens. The substance ithildin, made from mithril, reflected only starlight and moonlight, and it seems likely that ithildin, or something very similar, was used by the Dwarves to write their moon-letters.


* Moontower
A name of Minas Ithil, apparently still retained even after it was captured and renamed Minas Morgul.


* Morannon
The main (northern) entry to Mordor. Translated 'the Black Gate'. Also called the Gates of Mordor.
-----
The Black Gate that Sauron built across the entrance of the valley of Ud?, the only opening in the mountainous defences of his Black Land of Mordor.


* Mordor|Land of Shadow
'The Black Land', also called the Land of Shadow; Sauron's realm east of the Ephel D?th.
-----
Sauron's Black Land.
 After the destruction of the strongholds of evil in the north of Middle-earth at the end of the First Age, Sauron fled southwards seeking new lands. At the end of the first millennium of the Second Age, he chose a land walled by mountains, and there built his great fortress of Barad-d?. After Sauron settled there, the land became known as Mordor (the Black Land) - no record of an earlier name for this region exists.
 After the defeat of Sauron in the War of the Last Alliance, Mordor was taken under the control of Gondor, and the Gondorians built fortifications around it to prevent the return of evil things; the greatest of these was Minas Ithil (later Minas Morgul). As Gondor's power faded, however, Mordor once again fell into the hands of the Enemy, and after two thousand years of relative peace, the Nazg? returned and claimed the land once again in the name of Sauron. Sauron himself, however, dwelt at Dol Guldur in Mirkwood, and did not himself return openly to Barad-d? until some seventy years before the War of the Ring.
 In that War, Sauron's power was finally defeated when the One Ring was cast into the Cracks of Doom, and the land of Mordor once again came under the control of the South-kingdom.
-----
The Geography of Mordor: Mordor was a land of approximately rectangular shape, measuring some 600 miles east to west and 400 north to south. On all but its eastern borders, where it marched with Rh? and Khand, it was surrounded by the mountains of the Ered Lithui and the Ephel D?th.
 Offshoots of its mountain fences divided the land into two distinct regions, the barren uplands of Gorgoroth in the northwest, and the more fertile southern plain of Nurn, where the inland sea of N?nen lay.
 In the far northwest of Mordor, where the mountains of the Ered Lithui and Ephel D?th came together, lay a valley named Ud? (after the ancient fortress of Melkor in the north of the World). This was the only break in Mordor's western mountain-defences, and Sauron built a great gate, the Morannon, at its mouth to protect his realm.
-----
The History of Mordor:
c. II 1000 to II 3262: Mordor is not mentioned in the histories of Middle-earth before the end of the first millennium of the Second Age, when Sauron chose it as his dwelling place. While its natural defences must have influenced his decision, we are told that the main reason for his choice was Orodruin, the great volcano that lay in the central regions of the Plateau of Gorgoroth, and which Sauron used in his sorcery, including the forging of the One Ring.
 Through the rest of the Second Age, Mordor became a base for Sauron's struggle for power in Middle-earth. Though he had many successes in this struggle, at one time controlling all of Eriador, he also suffered many setbacks at the hands of the Elves and, especially, the N?en?eans.
 His worst reverse came in II 3262 when Ar-Pharaz?, the last King of N?enor, landed in Middle-earth with an unstoppable army. Sauron's forces fled, and he offered himself as hostage to Ar-Pharaz?, leaving Mordor and travelling with the victorious N?en?eans back to their island home.
 We are told little of Mordor after Sauron left it - his armies having fled, it must have been an empty, barren place for a time. Eventually, though, some part of his followers seem to have returned. After the destruction of N?enor and the founding of Gondor by Elendil and his sons, one of their first works was the building of Minas Ithil at the feet of the Ephel D?th 'as a threat to Mordor', which suggests that even with Sauron absent, the remaining inhabitants of the Black Land posed a threat of their own.
-----
II 3320 to II 3441: Sauron himself secretly returned to the Black Land after the Downfall of N?enor, and the Gondorians were apparently unaware of this for a time. Soon, though, Orodruin burst into life once more, and the Men of Gondor understood that the Dark Lord had returned to Barad-d?.
 After more than a century, in 3429, Sauron had rebuilt his armies sufficiently to contemplate an assault on the newly founded kingdom of Gondor on his western borders. He attacked and took Minas Ithil, but Isildur (who dwelt there at that time), escaped and fled north to his father in Arnor.
 Sauron's stroke was mistimed, for he was not yet strong enough to capture Osgiliath, Gondor's capital, and this gave Elendil the time to forge a military alliance with his friend Gil-galad, the last High King of the Noldor. Elendil and Gil-galad marched with the host of this Last Alliance to the gates of Mordor, where they worsted Sauron in a mighty battle on the plain afterwards called the Dagorlad. There followed the seven-year Siege of Barad-d?, but the forces of the Last Alliance eventually captured and destroyed the Dark Tower, and consigned Sauron to the shadows.
III 1 to c. III 1980: Through some two thousand years of the Third Age, Mordor was a deserted and empty land, under the control of the Gondorians (although none of that people dwelt there). As time passed, though, and the power and might of Gondor dwindled, the watch on the borders of Mordor was relaxed.
 In III 1975, the Battle of Fornost was fought in the north, and the forces of Angmar were defeated. The Witch-king of Angmar (the Lord of the Nazg?) fled into the south and entered Mordor, taking it again in the name of Sauron and gathering the others of his order there. The Gondorian watch on Mordor had not been maintained, and after the Dark Plague some three hundred years earlier, Minas Ithil and the other forts and castles on Mordor's borders stood empty. This made the Nazg?'s return all the easier.
c. III 1980 to III 3019: Soon after their return, the Nazg? attacked Minas Ithil, and took it once again. This was in the year 2000, twenty years after their return, and Minas Ithil withstood a two-year siege before it fell. We know the Tower was unmanned in 1980, so we must assume that the Gondorians had quickly garrisoned the city once they learned of the Nazg?'s return - this makes sense when we consider that the King of Gondor at that time was E?nil II, who was a great general before he became King.
 After its capture, Minas Ithil was renamed Minas Morgul, the Tower of Sorcery, and so the ancient dwelling of Isildur became a dark place and a threat to the Gondorians who had built it two thousand years before.
 For a thousand years, Mordor was to be ruled in Sauron's stead by the Lord of the Nazg?. Sauron himself was slowly and secretly growing in power at Dol Guldur to the north, and did not wish to reveal himself until he had sufficient strength to face his enemies.
 By III 2941, Sauron had grown sufficiently to face his foes. The White Council attacked Dol Guldur, but he had prepared for this and abandoned that stronghold, returning to his ancient kingdom of Mordor in the following year. He rebuilt his capital of Barad-d?, and began the ordering of Mordor for war.
 That war, the War of the Ring, was to see his final downfall. In its closing days, an army of Gondor stood before the Morannon and challenged him, and he sent overwhelming forces to answer their challenge. Secure in the certainty of his victory, he was unaware that two Hobbits, Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee, had secretly entered Mordor over the Ephel D?th with the One Ring. Travelling across Gorgoroth, they reached Orodruin and succeeded in destroying the Ring, bringing Sauron's rule to an end and leaving Mordor once again a desolate land under the control of Gondor.


* Morgai
'Black Fence', inner ridge much lower than the Ephel D?th and separated from it by a deep trough; the inner ring of the fences of Mordor.
-----
The inner fence of Mordor.
 A long valley and ridge in the eastern Ephel D?th, called the 'inner fence' of Mordor.


* Morgoth Bauglir|Morgoth|Black King
'The Black Enemy', name of Melkor, first given to him by F?nor after the rape of the Silmarils. Also called the Black King; the Dark Lord; the Enemy, Bauglir; and by the Dr?dain the Great Dark One.
-----
The First Dark Lord.
 'Morgoth' means 'Black Enemy'; 'Bauglir' is 'The Constrainer'.
 After his theft of the Silmarils and Darkening of Valinor, Morgoth fled the Valar, and returned to Middle-earth with Ungoliant before the beginning of the First Age. In his ancient fortress of Angband, far to the north of Beleriand, he made an Iron Crown for himself, with the Silmarils mounted upon it.
 In the first year of the First Age, the Noldor returned to Middle-earth to make war on Morgoth for the recovery of the Silmarils. The history of that Age is the history of the hopeless wars of the Noldor against Morgoth.


* Morgul Vale
The valley behind Minas Morgul in the Ephel D?th.
 Also called Imlad Morgul, the valley of the Morgulduin in the western Ephel D?th. At its outflow into Ithilien stood Minas Morgul.


* Morgul-wounds|Morgul-wound
Wounds inflicted by evil blades.
 The weapons of Sauron's greatest servants - or, at least, of the Nazg? - carried dark enchantments that cursed the wounds they inflicted. The wounds themselves varied; that suffered by Steward Boromir left in crippling pain and shortened his life, while the wound taken by Frodo on Weathertop threatened to make him a wraith.


* Morgulduin
The stream of Imlad Morgul.
 The pale stream that flowed out of the valley of Imlad Morgul, and past the gates of Minas Morgul itself, before passing southwestward through Ithilien and out into the River Anduin.


* Moria
'The Black Chasm', later name for Khazad-d? (Hadhodrond), the great works of the Dwarves of Durin's race under the Misty Mountains.
-----
The Black Chasm; the name given to Khazad-d? after its desertion by the Dwarves, after which it became a dark and evil place.
 The name 'Moria' is often used as a synonym for Khazad-d?. This is not strictly correct - 'Moria' was not used of the ancient Dwarf-city until after it was deserted by the Dwarves themselves - but by the late Third Age the two names had come to be used interchangeably.


* Moria Gate|Moria-gate|Gates of Moria|Gate of Moria
The doors of Khazad-d?.
 Also appearing in the form 'Moria-gate', a term used for either of the two gates of Moria. One opened westward to the old Elvish land of Eregion, the other eastward onto the valley of Nanduhirion.

-----
The river of the Blackroot Vale.
 A river that rose under the shadows of the White Mountains (hence its name, meaning 'black root') and flowed approximately south through the lands of Gondor. It flowed into the Ringl?above the ancient port of Edhellond.


* Morwen Eledhwen|Morwen|Lady of Dor-l?in|Lady of Dor-lomin

* Mount Fang
A name for the tower of Orthanc.
 A picturesque name for Orthanc, the citadel of the Wizard Saruman. 'Mount Fang' translates Orthanc's name as if it were Elvish, but the meaning 'Cunning Mind' was also possible if the name is interpreted in the old language of the Rohirrim.


* Mount Gram
The domain of Golfimbul.
 The mountain home of the goblins that followed Golfimbul. Its precise location is nowhere identified, but circumstantial evidence suggests that it lay among the peaks of the northern Misty Mountains.

* Mountain Wall
A poetic name for the Pel?i.
 A term that appears just once, in Bilbo's poem 'E?endil was a mariner'. The meaning is not completely certain, but it seems to describe the Pel?i, the Mountains of Defence that ranged along the eastern borders of Valinor.

 In the central parts of northern Mirkwood, north of the Old Forest Road, lay a scattered range of hills. A jumble of fir-covered, low-lying hills to the west rose to reach greater heights in the east, together forming a range nearly one hundred miles in length. Historically, the Second Age saw these mountains inhabited by Silvan Elves, who knew the range as the Emyn Duir, the Dark Mountains.
 During the Third Age, the power of Sauron spread across the Mountains as it did throughout the rest of the Forest, they became populated by hideous creatures. Just as Greenwood the Great was renamed Mirkwood at this time, its northern hills also took on a new name: Emyn-nu-Fuin, the Mountains of Mirkwood.


* Mountains of Mist
The Misty Mountains of the Hithaeglir.
 A name occasionally used for the range more commonly called the Misty Mountains.


* Mountains of Moria
The three peaks above old Khazad-d?.
 The three mountains, Celebdil, Caradhras and Fanuidhol, beneath which Khazad-d? was delved by the Dwarves. The main body of their city, which was later called Moria, seems to have been beneath Celebdil, which they called Zirakzigil, and which was crowned by Durin's Tower.


* Mountains of Shadow
The northern range of the Ered Wethrin.
 The Ered Wethrin, so named because their towering peaks shut out the sun from the lands of Mithrim and Dor-l?in that lay in Hithlum to the north.


* Mountains of Terror

A Man of great power and importance in the land of Mordor, the ambassador of Sauron. He was sent by Sauron to treat with the Captains of the West at the Black Gate of Mordor prior to the last battle of the War of the Ring. Had his master won that war, he would have ruled the defeated western lands from a rebuilt Isengard, in the place of Saruman. That was not to be, though, and of his fate after the Downfall of Barad-d? nothing is known.


* Mouths of Anduin
The wide estuary region known as the Ethir.
 The wide and wandering delta of the River Anduin, where it flowed out into the Bay of Belfalas.


* Mouths of Entwash
The wetlands of the Entwash delta.
 The River Entwash was the greatest of the tributaries of Anduin, and where the two rivers met, a mighty delta formed, measuring a hundred miles from the splitting of the Entwash to its final inflow into Anduin. This delta formed the Mouths of Entwash.
 So great was the inrush of Entwash that Anduin could not carry all its water, and so a marshland formed on the Anduin's eastern bank, called Nindalf, or Wetwang in the Westron tongue.


* Mouths of Sirion
Haven of the Exiles of Gondolin.
 The delta of the River Sirion, where it flowed into the Bay of Balar. After the destruction of the lands of Doriath and Gondolin, many of their people gathered here, and dwelt under the lordship of E?endil.

Bilbo Baggins' paternal grandfather, Mungo married Laura Grubb and had five children; the eldest was Bilbo's father Bungo.


* Mushrooms|Mushroom
A tasty kind of edible fungus, and a particular favourite of the Hobbits. In the Shire, it seems those that grew in the boggy region of the Marish were the most prized. Farmer Maggot grew them in his fields, and in The Lord of the Rings Frodo remembers stealing mushrooms from Maggot's fields as a child. He revisited the same farm years later, and Old Maggot gave him a parting gift - a basket of mushrooms.

The last King to rule in Khazad-d?.
 The son of King Durin VI of Khazad-d?, who became King after his father was slain by the Balrog known as Durin's Bane. N?n's kingship lasted only a year, before he too was slain - his son Thr?n I led the remnant of Durin's Folk away into the north.


* N?n II|N?n|Nain
The heir of ?n.
 King of Durin's line, successor to ?n. He led the Dwarves of Durin while they abode in the Grey Mountains. Late in his reign, dragons came south out of the Forodwaith, and began to assail the Dwarves.

-----
The dark and ancient woods on the banks of the River Celon in East Beleriand. It was here that Thingol met with Melian, and many years later the forest became the home of E? the Dark Elf.


* Nan-tasarion
A name for the Land of Willows.
 One of several names used to describe the watery region where the waters of the Narog flowed into Sirion. A forest of willow-trees grew there, from which it took its many names: Nan-tasarion, Tasarinan and (most commonly) Nan-tathren are all Elvish names meaning 'willow valley'.


* Nan-tathren

-----
The Land of Willows in the south of Beleriand.
 In the region where the River Narog met the great River Sirion, a little to the north of the Sirion's Mouths, lay the land of Nan-tathren.

It played little part in history, except that the Exiles of Gondolin rested here for a while on their long journey south from their city's ruin.


* Nandor|Nando
Said to mean 'Those who turn back': Elves from the host of the Teleri who refused to cross the Misty Mountains on the Great Journey from Cuivi?en, but of whom a part, led by Denethor, came long afterwards over the Blue Mountains and dwelt in Ossiriand (the Green-elves); for those who remained east of the Misty Mountains see Silvan Elves.
-----
The followers of Lenw?
 Telerin Elves who turned aside from the Great Journey east of the Misty Mountains, and journeyed down the River Anduin. Some few later came into Beleriand and dwelt in Ossiriand, while those that remained founded realms of their own. The people of L?ien were of this kind, as were the Wood-elves of Mirkwood.


* Nandorin
Of or pertaining to the Nandor.


* Nandorin (language)|Nandorin
The language of the Nandor, those Telerin Elves who broke from the Great Journey east of the Misty Mountains.

-----
The hidden fortress on the River Narog.
 The stronghold and realm of Finrod Felagund, founded by him on the model of the halls of Menegroth in Doriath.
 The stronghold of Nargothrond was carved into the rock beneath Taur-en-Faroth, and could only be approached by a narrow path along the high banks of the River Narog. No bridge was built across the river until late in its history. The citadel long lay hidden from Morgoth, and was ruled wisely for long years by Finrod. After he was lost in the Quest of the Silmaril, his brother Orodreth expelled the usurping sons of F?nor, Celegorm and Curufin, and was lord in Nargothrond.
 The lands to the north of the citadel were considered part of its realm, and the people of Nargothrond kept unceasing watch on the grasslands to the north; the Talath Dirnen or Guarded Plain.
 When T?in dwelt in Nargothrond, he persuaded the Elves who dwelt there to change their long policy of secrecy, and openly attack the servants of Morgoth. So the Dark Lord discovered the city's location, and sent out an army under Glaurung to sack and destroy it.
 The name means 'Halls of (the River) Narog'.


* N?i?Narie

* Narmacil I|Narmacil
Seventeenth King of Gondor.
-----
The heir of Atanatar the Glorious.
 Narmacil I, son of Atanatar II Alcarin, inherited the Kingship of Gondor when the South-kingdom was at the height of its power and wealth. He was not a great King, and indeed soon tired of the role. In III 1240, after just fourteen years on the throne, he turned over the rule of Gondor to his nephew Minalcar, who ruled as Regent through the rest of Narmacil's titular Kingship.
 Narmacil's Regent Minalcar was a powerful and energetic Man, who routed the armies of the Easterlings, fortified the borders of Gondor and actively pursued diplomacy with Gondor's neighbouring tribes. It is not recorded, though, that his uncle King Narmacil had any hand in any of Minalcar's great endeavours. Narmacil, in fact, is chiefly remembered as being Gondor's second childless King, the first having been Tarannon Falastur in the tenth century.
 Narmacil I sat on the throne of Gondor for sixty-eight years, but for fifty-four of these years Minalcar ruled Gondor as Regent. Narmacil died childless, and was succeeded by his younger brother Calmacil.

-----
The lady of tears.
 A Queen of the Valar, the sister of N?o and Irmo, who dwells alone on the western borders of the World. Nienna ranks as one of the eight Aratar, the most powerful of the Valar.
 Grief and mourning are Nienna's province; in her halls in the distant west, she weeps for the suffering of Arda. Her part in the Music of the Ainur was one of deep sadness, and from this grief entered the world in its beginning.
 She teaches pity and endurance; though she rarely travels to the joyful city of Valmar, she goes more often to the halls of her brother Mandos to comfort and counsel those in the Halls of Waiting. The Maia Ol?in, who was later to travel to Middle-earth as Gandalf, learned much from her.
 Nienna played a part in the making of the Two Trees of Valinor; she wept on the mound of Ezellohar, watering it with her tears. After the destruction of the Trees by Melkor, she once again wept on their wounded remains, cleansing the filth of Ungoliant, and helping to bring forth the last fruit and flower that were to become the Sun and the Moon.
 The pity of Nienna is most clearly seen in her support for Melkor when he sued for the pardon of the Valar. Though she spends her time in the world mourning for the destruction he has wreaked in Arda, when he sued for release after his three ages of Captivity, Nienna spoke on his part.
 Of Nienna's appearance we have almost no knowledge. The only hint is in Quenta Silmarillion 9, 'Of the Flight of the Noldor', where she 'cast back her grey hood'. Given that Gandalf was her student, this might (though somewhat doubtfully) have some relevance to his title, the Grey.

The loss of Elendil's son Isildur in the Disaster of the Gladden Fields led to a chain of events that separated Arnor in the north from Gondor in the south, and the two kingdoms continued to follow different paths through history.
 Arnor, the North-kingdom of the D?edain, was ruled by the direct descendants of Isildur, beginning with Valandil, his youngest son. Though the bloodline of the Northern D?edain came directly from the old High King, theirs was a troubled realm. Internal strife and war with Angmar saw Arnor become fractured and eventually destroyed, leaving the D?edain of the North a dwindled and wandering people.

-----
Ancient Home of the D?edain.
 The island kingdom of the D?edain, raised from the sea by the Valar as a gift and reward to the Men who had remained faithful through the dark years of the First Age. The Edain who had dwelt in Beleriand were led to the island in II 32 by Elros the Half-elven, who unlike his brother Elrond had chosen to be counted among Men rather than Elves.
 Elros became the first King of N?enor, taking the name Tar-Minyatur. Under his rule, and the rule of his descendants, the N?en?eans rose to become the most powerful nation of Men in that or any other age. Their mighty ships returned to Middle-earth in II 600, and there they founded havens and cities.
 For the early part of their history, the N?en?eans were closely allied with the Elves of Tol Eress?, which lay close to their western shores. The Elves visited them often, and taught them much, but the N?en?eans themselves were forbidden to sail westwards, because the Valar feared they would become envious of the Undying Lands they and the Elves inhabited. As their greatness and power grew, the N?en?eans began to turn against the Ban of the Valar, and at last Ar-Ad?akh?, who became King in II 2899 turned openly against it, though he did not dare defy it.
 The last King of N?enor was Ar-Pharaz? the Golden, who usurped the throne of the rightful queen M?iel in II 3255. He took his armies to Middle-earth to make war upon Sauron, and so great had the N?en?eans become that Sauron's forces deserted him. Seeing an opportunity to destroy his enemy, Sauron sued for peace and returned with the King to N?enor. He gradually gained Ar-Pharaz?'s trust, and persuaded him to sail openly against the Valar. This he did in II 3319, but as he set foot on the forbidden shores of Aman, the Land of Gift was taken away and swallowed beneath the waves forever.
 Some few survived the Downfall; Elendil, his sons and his followers had prepared themselves for the disaster and taken ship, and were driven back across the seas to Middle-earth. There they founded the famous realms of Arnor and Gondor, though these were but a dim reflection of the glory of N?enor at its height.
 The name means 'Land in the West' (i.e. west from Middle-earth).

 A river of N?enor, the second longest after the Siril. It flowed westward out of the central regions of the island, and as it approached the sea, its waters spread to form the fragrant lake of N?inen. Its mouth was at the haven of Eldalond? on the shores of the Bay of Eldanna.


* N?eth|Nuneth
Mother of Erendis.


* Nurn

* Nurtal?Valin?eva|Nurtale Valinoreva
'The Hiding of Valinor'.


* Nurufantur
One of the F?nturi; the earlier 'true' name of Mandos, before it was replaced by N?o. See Olofantur.


* Oakenshield
The title and surname of King Thorin II of Durin's Folk.
 Thorin acquired the title long before he became King. When he was just fifty-three (a young age for a Dwarf) he marched with a mighty Dwarf-army to the valley they called Azanulbizar, Nanduhirion beneath the East-gate of Moria. There they fought the Battle of Nanduhirion, the last and greatest in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs. In that battle, Thorin's shield was broken, so he cut a bough from an oak-tree with his axe, and used that instead to fend off his enemies' blows, or to club them. It was that oaken branch that gave Thorin his surname, but it did not completely save him from injury - it is recorded that he was wounded in the battle.
 That is the legend of Thorin's surname within Tolkien's tales, but in fact it comes from a real-world source. Like many Dwarvish names, it appears in the Norse poem V?usp?in the form Eikinskjaldi, but there it is the personal name of a Dwarf, not a surname as in Tolkien's work.

 One of the commonest trees in Middle-earth, found throughout its forests.


* Oath of Eorl|Eorl's Oath
Eorl's oath to Cirion of Gondor.

* Oath of F?nor|Oath of Feanor|F?nor's Oath|Feanor's Oath
The dooming words of F?nor and his sons.
-----
"They swore an oath which none shall break, and none should take, by the name even of Il?atar, calling the Everlasting Dark upon them if they kept it not..."
(Quenta Silmarillion 9, Of the Flight of the Noldor)
-----
The dreadful irrevocable oath taken by F?nor and his seven sons in the city of Tirion. They swore in the name of Il?atar that they would not rest until the three Silmarils were in their hands, and to make war on any who withheld them.
 At the time the Oath was sworn, Morgoth held all three of the Silmarils, having stolen them from F?nor's stronghold at Formenos. Driven by the unbreakable Oath, F?nor led the greater part of the Noldor out of Aman and back to Middle-earth, in hopeless pursuit of the Dark Lord. F?nor himself was mortally wounded by Balrogs in the Noldor's first assault. From that time on, while Morgoth held the three Silmarils in his Iron Crown, the Elves of Beleriand were bound by a common enemy.
 The true danger of the Oath was revealed after Beren and L?hien recovered one of the three Silmarils from the depths of Angband. Thereupon, the Sons of F?nor made war upon the other Elves of Beleriand for the recovery of the Jewel. They attacked and destroyed the kingdom of Doriath, killing Thingol's Heir Dior. When the Silmaril escaped them there, they discovered that it was held at the Mouths of Sirion by the Dior's daughter Elwing; again they attacked, and again the Silmaril escaped them. Carried out to sea by the power of Ulmo, Elwing brought it her husband E?endil the Mariner, and they sailed with it back into the West.
 That Silmaril was lost to F?nor's sons, but two more remained on Morgoth's Crown. After the War of Wrath and Morgoth's defeat at the end of the First Age, just two of the original oath-takers survived, F?nor's eldest sons Maedhros and Maglor. They stole the Silmarils from the camp of the victorious host, but because of the evils they had committed in recovering them, they found that they could no longer touch the holy Jewels without enduring searing pain. In despair, Maedhros threw imself and his Silmaril into the depths of the Earth, while Maglor cast his into the deep ocean. Maglor was the last of the oath-takers, and was said to wander the shores of the world lamenting his pain and loss.


* Oathbreakers
Those who waited among the Paths of the Dead.
 The Men of the Mountains, whose King swore allegiance to Isildur and the D?edain in the last years of the Second Age. They had worshipped Sauron in the Dark Years before the foundation of Gondor, and when the time came for them to fulfil their oath, and fight beside Isildur against their ancient master, they broke their word, and hid in the mountains. Isildur cursed them to survive without rest until their oath was fulfilled. So they haunted the Paths of the Dead throughout the Third Age, waiting for Isildur's heir to appear and grant them the chance to fulfil their word at last.


* Of Many Colours|Many Colours
Title claimed by Saruman when he revealed his dark intentions to Gandalf in Orthanc.


* Oghor-hai|Oghor
Name given to the Dr?dain by Orcs.
-----
The Orcs' name for the Dr?dain.
 The name used by the Orcs to describe that race of Men otherwise known as the Dr?dain or Woses. They were believed by the Orcs to possess magical powers, and they therefore feared the Oghor-hai greatly.


* Ogres
A mysterious and fearsome race.
 Monstrous and destructive creatures of legend and folklore. In fact, it is doubtful whether Ogres ever existed in Middle-earth. Tolkien mentions them only once, in The Hobbit, during Bilbo's Riddle-game with Gollum. In his attempt to solve Gollum's fifth riddle, Bilbo '... sat in the dark thinking of all the horrible names of all the giants and ogres he had ever heard told of in tales...'. Since no ogre is ever again mentioned, it is entirely possible that they were a mythical race even to the inhabitants of Middle-earth.


* Ohtar
'Warrior', esquire of Isildur, who brought the shards of Elendil's sword to Imladris.
-----
The squire of Isildur. One of only three survivors of the Disaster of the Gladden Fields, Ohtar rescued the shards of Elendil's sword, Narsil, and brought them safely back into the North.


* ?n (companion of Bilbo)|?n|Oin
Son of Gr?n, one of the Dwarves of the following of Thorin II Oakenshield who reclaimed Erebor from Smaug. He later travelled to Moria with Balin, and was lost in the ill-fated attempt to reoccupy Khazad-d?.


* ?n (King of Durin's Folk)|?n|Oin
King over the Dwarves of the Grey Mountains.
 ?n was King of Durin's line, successor to Gl?n. In his time, the Dwarves of Durin's Folk still dwelt in the Grey Mountains of the north. In the later years of his reign, the Shadow returned to Dol Guldur in Mirkwood, and Orcs and other evil things began to multiply in the northern mountains. In ?n's last years, the Orcs plundered Moria, which was then deserted, and took it to dwell in. This was but the first of the calamities that were to befall the House of Durin over the coming centuries.
 ?n was 250 years old when he died, having reigned as King for 103 of those years. He was succeeded by his son N?n, who became King N?n II.


* Oiolair?Oiolaire|Bough of Return
'Ever-summer'; an evergreen tree brought to N?enor by the Eldar of Eress?, from which was cut the Bough of Return set upon the N?en?ean ships. Called also Bough of Return.
-----
'Ever-summer'.
 A sweet-scented tree that grew in N?enor, and especially in the western region known as N?imaldar. It was the custom among N?en?ean mariners to place a cut bough of oiolair?on the prows of their ships, as a symbol of good fortune.


* Oioloss?Oiolosse|Amon Uilos
'Ever-snow-white', the Mountains of Manw?in Aman.

The most common name among the Eldar for Taniquetil, rendered into Sindarin as Amon Uilos; but according to the Valaquenta it was the uttermost tower of Taniquetil.


* Oiom??Oiomure
A region of mists near to the Helcarax?


* Old Company
Name given to the original members of T?in's band in Dor-C?rthol.


* Old Ford
The main crossing of the Anduin in the north.
 The point where the Old Forest Road crossed the River Anduin, about forty miles downriver from the Carrock. In older times, the river was crossed by a stone bridge here, but by the end of the Third Age, the bridge had long since disappeared, and the crossing was no more than a simple ford.


* Old Forest
The ancient forest extending eastwards from the borders of Buckland.
-----
A strange northern remnant of the great forest of the Second Age.
 A remnant of the great forests of Middle-earth in the Second Age; most of these forests were cut down by the N?en?eans, but two isolated woodlands remained. The Old Forest was the northern of these two (the other being Fangorn in the south), on the eastern borders of the Shire.


* Old Forest Road
The road descending from the Pass of Imladris, crossing Anduin at the Old Ford, and traversing Mirkwood. Also called Forest Road, Men-i-Naugrim, Dwarf-road.
-----
The east-west road that led through Greenwood the Great.
 The main route through the great forest originally known as Greenwood the Great and latterly as Mirkwood. Where the Road crossed the Great River, there was originally a stone bridge, but the later years of the Third Age the bridge had been lost and the river was crossed by the Old Ford. From there, a traveller following the Road east would cross some miles of open country before plunging into the depths of the forest. The Road then ran directly east from one side of the forest to the other, covering more than two hundred miles beneath the canopy of trees before it emerged by the banks of the River Running.
 Of the origins of the Road we know little for certain. We can be sure that it existed before the end of the Second Age, because a record exists of the stone bridge being specially strengthened to carry the armies of the Last Alliance. A strong clue to its origins is presented in its Sindarin name, Men-i-Naugrim, meaning 'Dwarf-road'. The Dwarves had a tradition of road-building dating back to before the First Age, and it seems that they must have built the Forest Road to carry traffic between their western and eastern clans. It's particularly notable that the old bridge over the Anduin at the Road's western end lay almost exactly halfway between the ancient Dwarvish meeting-place at Gundabad to the north, and Durin's mansions of Khazad-d? to the south.


* Old Gammidgy
The nickname that gave rise to Sam Gamgee's family name.
 A nickname acquired by Hob Gammidge of Tighfield. Both Hob and his son, Hobson, followed a roping tradition, and Hobson gained a nickname of his own, based on the name Gammidgy; he became known as Roper Gamgee, the first use of the surname that would later be borne by Hobson's grandson Sam.


* Old Man Willow
The dark heart of the Old Forest.
 A name for the ancient willow tree that lay at the heart of the Old Forest, and from whom much of that forest's hatred of walking things was derived.


* Old Mill
The mill of the Hobbiton.
 The mill that stood on the north banks of the Water in Hobbiton, run by Ted Sandyman, but bought and demolished by Lotho Sackville-Baggins.


* Old Road
The road running east through Eriador.
 A name sometimes used for the East-West Road that lead through Eriador to Rivendell, and especially for its eastern reaches beyond the town of Bree.


* Old Rory Brandybuck
A common name for Rorimac the Master of Buckland.
 The name generally given to Rorimac Brandybuck, the Master of Buckland, in his later years. He was the grandfather of Meriadoc Brandybuck, noted for his hospitality and generosity. He was at Bilbo's farewell Birthday Party (he would have been ninety-nine years old at the time) and was the first to suspect the true meaning of Bilbo's disappearance at that Party - that he had set out on another adventure. Old Rory was succeeded as Master of Buckland by his elder son, Saradoc.

 One of the most notable varieties of the plant known as pipe-weed or Halflings' Leaf, grown in the region around Longbottom in the Shire's Southfarthing. It took its name from the famous old Hobbit who introduced pipe-weed to the Shire, the original 'Old Toby', Tobold Hornblower.


* Old Took
The venerable Gerontius.
 Title given the Thain Gerontius Took, in honour of his great age.


* Old Winyards
A red wine from the south of the Shire.
 A red wine from the Shire's Southfarthing, noted for its strength. Bilbo's father Bungo Baggins, who delved Bag End, seems to have laid down a large number of bottles of this wine. Bilbo gave a present of a dozen bottles to Rorimac Brandybuck, Master of Buckland at the time he left the Shire, but this still left plenty for his heir Frodo. The Old Winyards lasted another seventeen years, until the last drop was drunk by Frodo as he set out on his own adventures.


* Oldbuck Family|Oldbuck

-----
The doomed son of Calimehtar.
 One of the last Kings of Gondor, who worked during his short reign to build closer ties with the northern D?edain of Arthedain. He died, with both his sons, in the Battle of the Camp. The loss of Ondoher and his heirs threw Gondor into a political crisis.

One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them."
(Inscribed on the One Ring)
-----
The greatest of the Rings of Power, forged secretly by Sauron in the fires of Orodruin. The Ring not only transported the wearer into the Wraith-world, making him invisible to those in the real world, but also granted virtual immortality and mastery over the nineteen Great Rings, and all other magical Rings forged in Eregion in the middle of the Second Age. After Sauron's defeat at the end of that Age, the Ring was lost; the story of its recovery and ultimate destruction lie at the heart of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.


* Onodl?Onodlo
Sindarin name of the river Entwash.
-----
The ancient Elvish name for the Entwash.
 An important river that rose under the trees of Fangorn Forest, in the southern Misty Mountains. It flowed south through the land of Rohan (whose people called it the Entwash) until it met its tributary, the Snowbourn River out of the White Mountains. Then, it turned eastwards and flowed on to meet the Great River Anduin in a vast fenny delta, called the Mouths of Onodl?or the Mouths of Entwash.

Warring servants of the Dark Lords.
 Little is known for certain of the beginnings of the Orcs, the footsoldiers of the Enemy. It is said that they were in origin corrupted Elves captured by Melkor before the beginning of the First Age. In appearance, Orcs were squat, swarthy creatures. Most of them preferred the darkness, being blinded by the light of the Sun, but the kinds bred later in the Third Age such as the Uruk-hai could endure the daylight.

* Orgaladh
The day of the White Tree.
 The fourth day of the N?enorean week, equivalent to our Tuesday. This name was adapted from the Sindarin usage 'Orgaladhad' ('Day of the Trees', referring to the Two Trees of Valinor). The N?en?eans held the White Tree Telperion in special reverence, and Nimloth, the tree that grew in the King's Court at Armenelos, was said to be its descendant. Hence, they changed the name to Orgaladh ('Day of the Tree', referring to Telperion only).


* Orgaladhad
'Day of the Two Trees'; the fourth day of the Sindarin week, equivalent to modern Tuesday.

A Dwarf of the House of Durin, who accompanied his lord Thorin II Oakenshield on the Quest of Erebor.


* Orkish
The languages of the Orcs.
 A general term for the jumble of languages used by the Orcs, composed from corrupted borrowings from other languages of Middle-earth. The variations in Orkish between different tribes and types of Orc were so great that it was often useless for communication, and so a standard language was necessary. Sauron devised his Black Speech for this purpose in Mordor, but in practice the Common Tongue was more normally used.


* Orleg

-----
The son of Finarfin and younger brother to Finrod Felagund; he ruled in Nargothrond after Finrod was lost in the dungeons of Tol-in-Gaurhoth.


* Orodreth (Steward of Gondor)|Orodreth
The sixteenth Ruling Steward of Gondor, who inherited the Stewardship from his father Belecthor I. Orodreth shared his name with an illustrious Elf-lord of the First Age, Orodreth the younger brother of Finrod Felagund and late ruler of Nargothrond. Orodreth the Steward has left less of a mark on history, and indeed other than his dates we have no records of his rule. He was succeeded by his son, who ruled as Ecthelion I.


* Orodruin
'Mountain of Blazing Fire' in Mordor, in which Sauron forged the Ruling Ring; called also Amon Amarth 'Mount Doom'.
-----
Mount Doom.
 The fire-mountain in the northern parts of Mordor, in which Sauron forged the One Ring during the Second Age, and into which the same Ring was cast thousands of years later to bring about the Dark Lord's downfall.
 When Sauron chose the land of Mordor as his dwelling-place in the Second Age, Orodruin was the reason for his choice. He 'used the fire that welled there from the heart of the earth in his sorceries and his forging' (from Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age); the most famous result of his forging, and in fact the only one we know of for sure, was the One Ring, made in about the year II 1600. So powerful was the sorcery used in the making of the Ring that it could not be unmade, except by casting it back into the same fire that had forged it.
 The first opportunity to destroy the Ring came in the last year of the Second Age, at the end of the War of the Last Alliance. Sauron was defeated in that War, and Isildur cut the Ring from his hand. Elrond and C?dan counselled him to destroy the Ring then (the battle had taken place at the gates of Barad-d?, and Orodruin was therefore near at hand), but Isildur refused, and claimed the Ring for himself. So the doom of the Third Age was made.
 Orodruin was far more than a natural volcano - Sauron seems to have extended his own power into it, and was able to control its fires. It seems to have lain dormant when Sauron was away from Mordor, and sprung into life when his power grew. After the Downfall of N?enor, for example, the Exiles in Middle-earth first knew that Sauron had also escaped the Downfall when they saw smoke rising from Orodruin, and an Age later at the Council of Elrond, Boromir says 'Smoke rises once more from Orodruin that we call Mount Doom'.
 The name means 'Mountain of Red Flame'.


* Orom?Orome|Lord of the Forests
A Vala, one of the Aratar; the great hunter, leader of the Elves from Cuivi?en, spouse of Vana. The name means 'Horn-blowing' or 'Sound of Horns' (see Valar?a); in The Lord of the Rings it appears in the Sindarin form Araw.

-----
The city of the Elves of Eregion.
 The chief city of Eregion, the great Elvish nation of the mid-Second Age.

* Ostoher
Seventh King of Gondor.
-----
The rebuilder of Minas Anor.
 The son of Anardil and descendant of An?ion, who ruled Gondor as its seventh King. Early in his reign, he undertook a great construction work, the rebuilding and expansion of the Minas Anor. Reconstructing the citadel was a considerable task (some sources suggest that it took as long as ten years), and it seems to be the source of Ostoher's name (which means 'fortress lord'). After the rebuilding, Ostoher took Minas Anor as his summer residence, and this tradition was carried on by his successors.
 Much later in his reign, Gondor suffered its first serious assault since the defeat of Sauron some five centuries before. Bands of Wild Men appeared out of the East, threatening Gondor's eastern lands. By this time, Ostoher was in his old age, nearly 270 years old, and it fell to his heir Tarostar to meet the Easterling threat. He succeeded in driving back his enemies, but Ostoher died before his son's victory was complete.
 Ostoher ruled Gondor for eighty-one years, and was succeeded by his son, Tarostar, who became known as R?endacil I.


* Otho Sackville-Baggins
The frustrated heir of Bilbo Baggins.
 The son of Longo Baggins and Camellia Sackville. Otho's father Longo was Bilbo Baggins' uncle, making Otho himself Bilbo's cousin and heir. He and his wife Lobelia eagerly anticipated their inheritance: Bilbo's home at Bag End. Otho would never inherit that smial, though, because Bilbo changed his will to make Frodo Baggins his heir. Eventually, Frodo sold Bag End to Lobelia, but Otho had died six years earlier, and never owned the home he had coveted throughout his life.

 Just like the modern Gregorian calendar, the Shire Calendar regulated time by adding an extra day every four years. This extra day was known as the Overlithe: it occurred between Mid-year's Day and the second of the two normal Lithedays. It was treated as a special holiday by the inhabitants of the Shire.


* Paladin Took II|Paladin Took
The father of Peregrin Took.
 The thirty-first Thain of the Shire was Ferumbras Took III, who was unmarried and left no heir. As such, the line of descent from the Old Took's third son Isumbras IV came to an end, and the descent moved on to the line of his fourth son, Hildigrim. So the Thainship fell on Hildigrim's grandson Paladin, who became Thain Paladin II.
 At some point, it seems that Hildigrim or one of his descendants had moved a little away from the ancestral home of the Tooks at Great Smials. Paladin was a farmer who worked the lands around Whitwell - a village which, though it appears on no map, is known to have been close to Tuckborough in the western Green Hills.
 When Lotho Sackville-Baggins attempted his takeover of the Shire, Paladin came into his own. As the legitimate Thain, he refused to accept Lotho's authority, and when Lotho's ruffians were found in the Tookland, they were hunted and shot. So the Tookland remained independent while Lotho and later Sharkey took over the running of the rest of the Shire. A hundred of Paladin's archers marched to the Battle of Bywater and helped to defeat Sharkey's Men, but Paladin himself does not seem to have been at the battle.
 Paladin was married to Eglantine Banks, and together they had four children. The eldest three were daughters, Pearl, Pimpernel and Pervinca, but the youngest was a son. This was the famous Peregrin Took, who travelled with the Fellowship of the Ring, and would inherit Paladin's title to become Thain Peregrin I.

* Pelendur
Steward of Gondor.
-----
Steward to King Ondoher.
 The Steward to King Ondoher of Gondor, who was thrust into a position of power when his King, together with both his heirs, was lost in battle with the Wainriders. With the Council of Gondor, it fell to Pelendur to select an heir. There were two candidates: Arvedui of Arthedain, and E?nil, the Gondorian Captain and victor of the Battle of the Camp, who was descended from the Royal House of Gondor.
 As the direct descendant of Isildur himself, it could be said that Arvedui had the stronger claim, but Pelendur moved the Council to elect E?nil, who took the Kingship as E?nil II. All available evidence suggests that Pelendur continued to serve as Steward under the new King.
 Pelendur was a highly influential Steward, who accrued considerable power to his office. As well as effectively acting as regent during the interregnum, it was during his time that the office of Steward became hereditary. When Pelendur died, he was succeeded as Steward by his son Vorondil, and his grandson Mardil was to become the first of the Stewards to rule Gondor in his own right.

 The second of the Three Houses of the Edain originally dwelt east of the River Gelion, in the lands of Caranthir son of F?nor. After suffering dreadfully at the hands of Orcs, they lost their lord Haldad, and his daughter Haleth resolved to find her people a land to call their own. She led them eastward, and eventually they settled in the Forest of Brethil, with the leave of King Thingol in Menegroth.
 The main dwelling of the People of Haleth was a fenced compound known as Ephel Brandir, on the hill of Amon Obel in the middle of the forest. According to some tales, there were Dr?dain in the woods of Brethil too, with whom Haladin held a bond of friendship against the Orcs that raided their lands from the north.


* People of the Jewel-smiths
The Elves of Eregion.
 After the establishment of the land of Eregion in the year II 750, the followers of Celebrimbor became famous for their works of art and craft. They were known as the M?dain, the jewel-smiths, and formed a brotherhood known as the Gwaith-i-M?dain, the People of the Jewel-smiths. Their skill gained them the friendship of the Dwarves of nearby Khazad-d?, who valued such artistry, but their fascination with the making of things was to bring about their downfall.
 Nearly five hundred years after Eregion's foundation, a mysterious being appeared among its people. Calling himself Annatar, he had knowledge and skill beyond even that of the M?dain, and he offered this knowledge freely to the People of the Jewel-smiths. They accepted his offer, and for some three hundred years more Annatar taught them. Eventually, their skills were great enough the begin forging Rings of Power, of which they made many, and their greatest works were the Three Rings Narya, Nenya and Vilya. Through these Rings, they discovered to their horror that 'Annatar' was none other than their ancient enemy Sauron, who had corrupted their great work to his own ends. Sauron was enraged at his discovery, and his armies swept across Eriador and into Eregion, destroying the country of the Jewel-smiths.

* Peregrin 'Pippin' Took I|Peregrin|Pippin
Hobbit of the Shire, one of the Fellowship of the Ring.
-----
Twentieth Shire-thain of the Took line.
 Son of Paladin Took II of Great Smials, and later Thain Peregrin I; he travelled with the Company of the Ring. With Meriadoc Brandybuck, he was separated from the Company at Parth Galen, and taken captive by Orcs. Escaping into Fangorn Forest, he saw the destruction of Isengard and travelled with Gandalf to Minas Tirith, where he became a bondsman of Steward Denethor II.
-----
Journey to Rivendell, 23 September to 20 October III 3018: Pippin, as Peregrin was universally known, was the youngest of Frodo's companions. He was only twenty-eight years old when he set out with Frodo and Sam from Bag End on the first part of their great journey, which was considered very young for a Hobbit. At first, he seemed to be rather unsuited to a long journey - through the early part of their travels, we see him regularly calling for rests or meals. As befitted the son of the Shire's Thain, though, he had a good general knowledge of that land and its people.
-----
Peregrin's Life After the War of the Ring: Peregrin inherited the title Thain of the Shire in the year IV 13 (1434 by the Shire-reckoning). During his Thainship, he remained in close contact with Gondor, and built a library of great historical importance at Great Smials. The works he collected were mainly concerned with the history of N?enor and the Exiles after its Downfall, and so were of little interest to the Hobbits of the Shire, but were of great significance to the larger world. The Tale of Years was probably prepared at Great Smials, with help from Meriadoc Brandybuck.


* Periannath|Perian
'Halflings', a Sindarin name for Hobbits (singular Perian).

* Pincup
A village of the Shire's Southfarthing.
 A small village of the Shire. It lay in the northern corner of the Southfarthing, some miles south of the Three-Farthing Stone, in that hilly part of the Shire known as the Green Hill Country. It seems to have been built in the southern slopes of the Green Hills, and was reached by only a single road, apparently leading from the larger settlement of Longbottom to the south.
 The origin of Pincup's name are mysterious. Perhaps the most likely possibility would be Old Englsh p? cuppe, 'pine hollow', but this is by no means certain. 'Pine hill' is another possibility, though this doesn't fit easily with the fact that the only known map of Pincup shows it below the Green Hills. More exotically, its name might even be connected with the colourful bird known as a chaffinch, a bird the Anglo-Saxons called a pinca.


* Pines|Pine
Common evergreen trees, found throughout the lands of Middle-earth, but especially in the highlands of Dorthonion, a land which took its name from the pine trees that grew there.

* Potatoes|Potato
Root vegetables that were apparently among the staple foods of the Hobbits. How they came to exist in Middle-earth is something of a mystery - in principle, they should not have appeared east of the Great Sea for several thousand years after the War of the Ring. Conceivably, the roots named 'potatoes' in Tolkien's work represent some other related plant, or a crop brought east by the N?en?eans that later became extinct.


* Powers of Arda

* Prince of the Halflings
Ernil i Pheriannath.
 A noble title given to Peregrin Took during his time in Minas Tirith in the War of the Ring, a translation of the Elvish Ernil i Pheriannath. Though exaggerated, it wasn't entirely inapt; he was after all the heir to the Thain of the Shire.


* Proudfoot Family|Proudfoot|Proudfoots|Proudfeet
A family of Hobbits of the Shire. All the members of this family mentioned in The Lord of the Rings were related to the Bagginses, since they were descended from Bilbo Baggins' uncle Bodo Proudfoot. There is some uncertainty about the plural form of 'Proudfoot' - the family themselves apparently used 'Proudfeet', but Bilbo pointedly preferred 'Proudfoots'.

-----
Ancient watchers of the Dunharrow road.
 The ancient carved images, thought to be of Woses or Dr?dain, that lined the road to Dunharrow in the White Mountains.


* Queen of Doriath
Melian the Maia.
 In the long years before the beginning of the First Age, the Telerin lord Elw?Singollo came upon Melian the Maia in the woods of Nan Elmoth. So Melian became the first and only of the Ainur to wed one of the Children of Il?atar, and together Thingol (as Elw?became known) and Melian founded a kingdom among the forests in the heart of Beleriand, and ruled it as King and Queen.
 Throughout much of its existence, the forest-kingdom was known as Eglador. When Morgoth returned to Middle-earth, he sent his orc-armies to ravage Beleriand. They were beaten back, but only at great cost, and so Melian put out her power to protect her country. She surrounded the forests of her home with a bewildering maze of powerful enchantments, the so-called Girdle of Melian. From that time, the land she ruled with Thingol was no longer known as Eglador, but took a new name, Doriath, the 'fenced land'.
 Melian and Thingol ruled in Doriath for some five centuries more. At last Thingol was slain, in his own treasuries by treacherous Dwarves of Nogrod. Melian in despair departed for her ancient home in the West of the World, and the Girdle that had protected Doriath was removed.
 Whether Melian was the last Queen of Doriath is open to question. Thingol's grandson Dior ruled for some years in Doriath after his grandfather's death, so Dior's spouse Nimloth might possibly have inherited Melian's title. There is, however, no evidence that Nimloth was ever referred to as the 'Queen of Doriath'.


* Queen of Gondor
Consort to the King of the South-kingdom.
 The title given to the spouse of the ruling King of Gondor (no Queen ruled Gondor in her own name at any time during its recorded history). The most famous Queens were Ber?hiel (Queen to King Tarannon Falastur) and Arwen Evenstar, the consort of Aragorn Elessar.


* Queen of N?enor|Queen of Numenor

-----
The ancient and noble tongue of the High Elves.
 The tongue of the High Elves in Valinor, the first to be recorded in writing. It was never widely used in Middle-earth except among the Noldor; the related Eldarin language, Sindarin, was more commonly spoken.

* Quest of Erebor
The quest to recover the Lonely Mountain.

 The quest of Beren Erchamion for a Silmaril from Morgoth's Iron Crown as Thingol's bride-price of his daughter L?hien. He was aided in the Quest by L?hien herself, King Finrod of Nargothrond and Huan the Hound of Valinor.


* Quickbeam
Hastiest of Ents.
 One of the younger Ents of Fangorn Forest belonging to the people of Skinbark. His name (a translation of Elvish Bregalad) was given because of uncharacteristic hastiness. The rowan-trees in his keeping suffered greatly at the hands of Saruman's Orcs, and he played a great part in the Ents' resulting attack on Isengard.

Their lord, Barahir, took the survivors of his House into hiding in the northern highlands, above the pine forests of that region, but they were harried and hunted by Morgoth's servant Sauron, and their numbers dwindled.
 At last, only thirteen Men remained, and Ragnor was one of these: a faithful servant and soldier of the House of B?r. One fateful night, as the outlaws slept by the shores of a mountain lake, they were set upon by Orcs and slain to a Man. Beren was absent from the camp, and survived, but Ragnor and all his companions were lost.


* Ramdal
'Wall's End' (see Andram), where the dividing fall across Beleriand ceased.
-----
'Wall's End'.

* R?a|Rana
'The Wanderer', a name of the Moon among the Noldor.
-----

* Rangers of Ithilien|Ranger of Ithilien|Ithilien Rangers|Ithilien Ranger
Gondor's secret soldiers east of Anduin.
 A force of the soldiers of Gondor, selected from the descendants of the people who had dwelt in Ithilien before it fell from Gondor's control. Dressed in camouflaging green and brown, they crossed the Anduin in secret to harass the forces of the Enemy in Gondor's old domain.


* Ranugad|Ran
The original form of 'Hamfast'.
 In his translation of the Red Book of Westmarch, Tolkien anglicised many Hobbit names. 'Ranugad' is an example of this process - it is the real name of the Hobbit named Hamfast Gamgee in the Lord of the Rings. Ranugad (often abbreviated to 'Ran') had a very similar meaning to the translated name, Hamfast.


* Ras Morthil
A name of Andrast.
-----
The northwestern limit of the Bay of Belfalas.
 The dark cape that edged the Bay of Belfalas to the northwest, also called Andrast. The mountain chain that ran along the length of the cape was the home of tribes of the Dr?dain.


* Rath D?en|Rath Dinen
The 'Silent Street' in Minas Tirity.
-----
The Silent Street.
 Behind the Closed Door, Fen Hollen, in the sixth circle of Minas Tirith, lay a steep, winding pathway that led down beneath the shadow of Mindolluin to Rath D?en, the Silent Street. This was the street that ran between the Houses of the Dead, where the great of Gondor, Kings and Stewards alike, were laid after death.
 The Kings of Gondor were buried in mansions or domed tombs, and the Street was lined with images of those who lay there. The Stewards had a House apart from the tombs of the Kings, the House of Stewards, where Denethor perished in III 3019.
 When the seedling of the White Tree was found on the slopes of Mindolluin by Gandalf, the Dead Tree that had stood in the courts of Minas Tirith was laid in Rath D?en, and the Hobbits Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took, of the Company of the Ring, were also given a place there after their deaths, beside the tomb of King Aragorn Elessar.


* Rathl?iel|Rathloriel
'Golden-bed', later name for the river Ascar, after the treasure of Doriath was sunk in it.
-----
'Goldenbed'
 The later name for the River Ascar, the northernmost of the six rivers that flowed through Ossiriand. Its name was changed after Beren led a force of Laiquendi to defeat a band of the Dwarves of Nogrod on its banks. The Dwarves had sacked the kingdom of Doriath, and with their defeat, the treasuries of Menegroth were emptied into the river. After that time it was known as Goldenbed, or Rathl?iel in Elvish.


* Rats|Rat
Rodent pests.
 Verminous creatures at least as common in Middle-earth as they are today.

The thundering chasms south of Brethil.
 The ravines into which the River Teiglin descended as it skirted the eaves of the Forest of Brethil. They were used by T?in Turambar to climb beneath the belly of Glaurung and slay him.


* Realms in Exile
The lands founded by Elendil and his sons.
 A name for Arnor and Gondor, the ancient North-kingdom and South-kingdom of the D?edain in Middle-earth. Arnor was destroyed during the Third Age, but at the end of that Age, the Westlands were reunited under Aragorn Elessar.


* Reckoning of Rivendell
The Reckoning of Rivendell or Imladris is the only recorded Elvish calendar. It contained six 'months' (more akin to seasons), rather than twelve, and its arrangement reflects the Elvish preference for counting in sixes and twelves. Because of their long lifespan, the Elves tended to divide time into Y?i of 144 years each, but they also had a period equivalent to a year, called a Loa or Coranar.
 Rather than adding one day every four years, as with the modern leap year, the Elves instead added three days every twelve years. In these years, the Enderi ('middle-days') of each year were doubled from the usual three to six. For precision, the last year of every third y? was shortened by three days, rather than lengthened (the last year of a y? was always a 'leap' year). This was a rare occurrence, happening only once every 432 years.

* Red Eye
Epithet and emblem of Sauron the Lord of the Rings.


* Red Maw
Carcharoth, the Wolf of Angband.
 A name for the mightiest wolf ever to live, given as an interpretation of his Elvish name, Carcharoth. He was bred in the pits of Angband as a guard against Huan the Hound of Valinor. Huan, it was prophesied, could only be slain by the greatest of all wolves, and Carcharoth the Red Maw proved to be that wolf. Before the gates of Angband, he bit Beren's hand from his arm, and with it the Silmaril he carried. Burned by the power of the Jewel, Carcharoth fled into the south. At last, he was discovered within the borders of Doriath itself, where he fought his last fight with Huan: the wolf and the hound took one another's lives in that combat.

The pass beneath Caradhras.
 A difficult pass in the central regions of the Misty Mountains beneath Caradhras. This was the pass attempted by the Company of the Ring as they journeyed on the Quest of Mount Doom.


* Regent of Gondor
A ruler of Gondor in place of its King.
 A translation of the Elvish term Karma-kundo, which literally means 'Guardian of the Helm', that was applied to those granted executive authority in place of a legitimate reigning King of Gondor. In all the history of the South-kingdom, only one Regent of this kind was ever appointed - Minalcar son of Calmacil.
 Minalcar was the grandson of Atanatar Alcarin, and already in the closing years of his grandfather's rule, he had become a forceful presence in the councils of the King, especially since neither of Atanatar's sons, Narmacil nor Calmacil, showed great interest in affairs of state. Just a few short years after Narmacil succeeded his father as King, he conferred the office of Karma-kundo on his nephew Minalcar, who from that point effectively ruled Gondor, though officially doing so in the King's name.
 Minalcar would eventually ascend to the throne of Gondor himself under his better-known name R?endacil II. Before doing so, though, he was Gondor's Regent for no less than sixty-four years.

The first Sunrise occurred soon after, marking the beginning of the First Age.


* Reunited Kingdom

 The name given to the N?en?ean realms of Arnor and Gondor after their reunification under King Aragorn II Elessar at the beginning of the Fourth Age.


* Revised Calendar
The Stewards' Reckoning.
 The N?en?ean calendar was devised during the Second Age, but even after the fall of Sauron at the end of that Age, the old calendar was maintained by the Exiles of N?enor in Middle-earth into the Third Age. The change of Age, though, introduced an error into the calendar that its designers had not foreseen, so that eventually a thorough revision became necessary. That revision was introduced by Mardil Voronw? whose Revised Calendar consisted of twelve months, each of thirty days, and five additional days that belonged to no month. This Revised Calendar, more commonly called the Stewards' Reckoning, was introduced nearly a thousand years before the War of the Ring, and became the standard calendar of Middle-earth.

* Rh?|Rhun
'East', used generally of the lands of the further East of Middle-earth.
-----
The eastern lands of Middle-earth.
 The little-known lands in the far east of Middle-earth, from where many attacks on Gondor and its allies came during the Third Age.
 We know almost nothing of the lands of beyond the great Sea of Rh? that stood on its borders with the western lands. Even Gandalf had never explored there, and though Aragorn had travelled there, we have no report of his doings.
 Of its ancient geography we can glean a little from the Silmarillion; far beyond the Sea of Rh? was another inland sea, the Sea of Helcar, and beyond that a range of red mountains known as the Orocarni. Somewhere in the lost east, too, lay Cuivi?en and Hild?ien, where Elves and Men first awoke: all the Children of Il?atar could trace their ancestries back to the eastward regions of Middle-earth.
 Rh? was far from an empty land; it was the domain of the Easterlings, Men of Darkness who were ready to follow both the Dark Lords and fought as their allies in war. These lands, too, were peopled by lost Elves, Avari and ?anyar, and by four of the seven clans of the Dwarves.
 During the Third Age, Rh? was visited by three Wizards; Saruman, Alatar and Pallando, and though Saruman returned into the west, the two Blue Wizards remained. Sauron himself journeyed into the eastward lands, in hiding from the White Council during the centuries known in the west as the Watchful Peace.

It was originally given to King Durin III of Khazad-d? by the Elves of Eregion, and it remained in his line for thousands of years until it was inherited by Thr?, the King under the Mountain at Erebor. It was during Thr?'s reign that Smaug descended on Erebor and drove the Dwarves into exile. Long after Erebor's destruction, Thr? passed the Ring to his son Thr?n, who dwelt for many years as an exile from his ancient home. At last, Thr?n set out on his own ill-fated Quest of Erebor, but he was captured by the spies of Sauron, and the Ring of Thr? was lost.

* Ring-bearer
A title of Frodo Baggins, who carried the One Ring from Hobbiton in the Shire south on the Quest of Mount Doom, and destroyed it by casting it into the Cracks of Doom.


* Ring-bearers
The title used for those three Hobbits (Bilbo Baggins, Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee) who had at one time borne the One Ring, and aided in its destruction. Because of their status as Ring-bearers, they were granted the passage of the Straight Road, and each eventually went to the Blessed Realm to live out their lives.
 Though only these three Hobbits are strictly counted as Ring-bearers, in fact the Ring was borne by other hands besides. Those who actually wore the Ring, as opposed to picking it up or holding it, are marked with an *.
-----
- Sauron*: He forged the One Ring for himself in c.II 1600 and bore it for c.1,840 years until his defeat in the Siege of Barad-d? in II 3441.
- Isildur*: Against the advice of Elrond and C?dan, he cut the Ring from Sauron's hand and took it himself. He did not bear it long - two years later, Isildur was ambushed by Orcs and the One Ring was lost in the Anduin, where it lay hidden for most of the Third Age.
- D?gol: He discovered the Ring while fishing the Gladden Fields in about the year 2463. He held it for only a short time before he was murdered by his friend Sm?gol (Gollum), who stole the Ring for himself.
- Gollum*: He took the Ring from D?gol, and soon hid with it in the roots of the Misty Mountains. He bore it in the dark for almost five hundred years.
- Bilbo Baggins*: He discovered the Ring 'by accident' while imprisoned beneath the Misty Mountains in July 2941, and claimed it from Gollum by defeating him in a Riddle-game. He carried it eastward to Erebor, and then back westward to the Shire, where he kept it. He bore the Ring for almost exactly sixty years.
- Frodo Baggins*: He was given the Ring by Bilbo on the advice of Gandalf. He was the Ring-bearer, who carried the One Ring from the Shire to Orodruin, to the very brink of the Cracks of Doom. Once there, the Ring's power overmastered him, and he named it to himself, but Gollum bit it from his finger and fell into the Fire. Frodo bore the Ring for seventeen years until its destruction.
- Gandalf: He held it for a matter of moments on the morning of 13 April III 3018, before throwing it into Frodo's fire. This was the moment that the Ring's fiery inscription appeared, confirming that it was the One Ring.
- Tom Bombadil*: He wore it on his finger for a moment on 27 September III 3018, but was famously unaffected by it. The reason that Tom was immune was the effects of the Ring remains an abiding mystery.
- Samwise Gamgee*: He bore the Ring for about two days in March III 3019, while Frodo his master was in the clutches of Orcs in the Tower of Cirith Ungol.


* Ring-finder
A title given to Bilbo Baggins, who came upon the One Ring in an orc-hold of the Misty Mountains.

Near its mouth was the ancient Elf-haven of Edhellond, and it marked the border between Anfalas to the west and Belfalas to the east.
 The name means 'Coldflood'.


* Rings of Power|Ring of Power
The magical rings made by Sauron and the M?dain.
 Eregion was a land founded by the Noldor in the eighth century of the Second Age. Their leader was Celebrimbor, the grandson of F?nor himself, and their skill and smithwork became famous throughout Middle-earth. In about the year II 1200, they began to receive emissaries from a mysterious stranger calling himself Annatar, who offered them even greater knowledge of their arts. Despite warnings from Gil-galad and Elrond, they accepted Annatar's offer, and he came to Eregion to teach them.
 For three hundred years the M?dain - as the Jewel-smiths of Eregion were known - studied at Annatar's side, and learned the making of magical rings. In about the year II 1500, the first of the Rings of Power was forged. Over the following decades, with Annatar's help, the Elves made sixteen Rings of Power, each set with a gemstone. Both the Elves and Annatar had their own secret aims, though, and each forged work of their own. Celebrimbor and the Elves made Three Rings more powerful than the others, Narya, Nenya and Vilya, the Rings of Fire, Water and Air.
 Unknown to the M?dain, 'Annatar' was none other than the Dark Lord Sauron. In the fires of Mount Doom in the dark land of Mordor, he forged a Ring of his own, to enslave the holders of the other Rings of Power. Filled with much of his own native power, this was the Ruling Ring, the One Ring that would make him Lord of all the Rings. But Sauron had not reckoned on the Elves forging their own Rings of Power; as he took up the One Ring for the first time, they became aware of it, and took off their own Rings to foil his ambition.
 Sauron in his anger swept out of Mordor with a great army. The land of Eregion was overwhelmed and destroyed and Celebrimbor was slain. The Three Rings of the Elves had already been sent away, but the Dark Lord claimed the remaining Rings of Power. Nine of these he used to subvert nine Men to his cause; this was the origin of the Nazg? or Ringwraiths. Seven he gave to the Dwarves with the same purpose, though with much less success, as the Dwarves proved resistant to their magic.
 Centuries later, at the end of the Second Age, Sauron fell in the War of the Last Alliance. Isildur cut the Ring from Sauron's hand, but he was lost in the River Anduin, and the Ruling Ring was lost with him. So the Elves could once again use the power of their Three Rings, as they did through the Third Age. At last, the One Ring was found again, and Sauron's quest to retrieve it resulted in the War of the Ring. Ultimately, the Ring was destroyed in the place where Sauron had forged it nearly five thousand years earlier. With that, the remaining Rings of Power, including even the Elves' Three Rings, lost the power they had held.

* Rohan
Form in Gondor of the Sindarin name Rochan(d), 'the Horse-country', the great grassy plain originally the northern part of Gondor, and then called Calenardhon. For the origins of the name, see Rochand.
-----
The wide land of the Rohirrim.
 Originally the Gondorian province of Calenardhon, the land north of the White Mountains was gifted by Steward Cirion to Eorl of the Northmen in III 2510. Eorl had led his men through great hardship from the far north to the aid of Gondor, and Cirion gave him the wide green lands of Calenardhon in recognition of his aid, swearing eternal friendship between old Gondor and the new land of Rohan.
 Rohan's history was one of conflict and war; with the Orcs of the White Mountains, the Dunlendings to the west, and ultimately with Saruman in Orthanc, whose lands bordered Rohan to the north.
 Nonetheless, the line of the Kings of Rohan stretched from Eorl's time to the War of the Ring and beyond. The Kings sat in the Golden Hall of Meduseld in Edoras, built by Eorl's son Brego. At the time of Gondor's greatest need, they kept the Oath of Eorl, and rode to the aid of their ancient allies at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.

-----

* R?endacil I Tarostar|R?endacil|Romendacil
Eighth King of Gondor, who took the title of R?endacil 'East-victor' after his repulse of the first attacks on Gondor by Easterlings.
-----
Victor over the Easterlings.
 The heir of Ostoher, who succeeded his father to become Gondor's eighth King. His name had originally been Tarostar, but he changed it to R?endacil to reflect the heroic events surrounding his succession.
 While his father Ostoher was still King, a horde of Easterlings attacked Gondor, the first time such a thing had been known. Ostoher was too old to take command of his own armies, so his son Tarostar took over the kingdom's defence. After two years of fighting, the old King died, and Tarostar inherited the Crown. Another eight years of warfare followed, but in the end Tarostar defeated his enemies and saved Gondor. He took the name R?endacil in celebration of his triumph; it means 'East-victor'.
 Neither R?endacil's triumph, nor Gondor's peace, were to last indefinitely. Some forty years after his first victory, the Easterlings massed once more, and again attacked the South-kingdom. R?endacil did not survive the assault, and it was left to his heir Turambar to face the fierce eastern warriors.
 R?endacil ruled Gondor for forty-nine years, and was succeeded by his son Turambar.


* R?endacil II Minalcar|R?endacil|Romendacil
For many years Regent and afterwards nineteenth King of Gondor, who took the title of R?endacil after his great defeat of the Easterlings in Third Age 1248.
-----
The second great victor over the Easterlings.
 The Man who would one day rule as one of Gondor's greatest Kings entered the World in inauspicious circumstances. He was born with the name Minalcar during the reign of Hyarmendacil II, and his father was Calmacil, the younger brother of the King's grandson Narmacil. As such, there seemed little likelihood of his succeeding the throne, but fate would decide otherwise.
 His uncle Narmacil took Gondor's throne in the year III 1226. Narmacil was not a man suited to the rigours of Kingship, and chose instead to appoint a Regent to rule the Kingdom in his stead. His choice settled on his nephew Minalcar, who took up the Regency in III 1240. Having been given this authority, Minalcar acted swiftly to secure Gondor's borders. He built a huge army, and marched with it into the east were he destroyed the Easterling forces between Rhovanion and the Sea of Rh?. After this great event, he took a title first used by his ancestor Tarostar in the sixth century, R?endacil the East-victor.
 Not satisfied with his great victory in the east, R?endacil set about fortifying the River Anduin. It was he who built the Pillars of the Argonath above Nen Hithoel, as a warning and a marker of Gondor's then northern border. He developed less tangible defences, too, working to cement a bond between Gondor and the Northmen who lived to the east. He went so far to send his son Valacar to live among them, an act from which the evils of the Kin-strife would eventually develop.
 Had Narmacil had a son, Minalcar R?endacil's Regency would have ended with his uncle's death in III 1294. Narmacil died without an heir, however, and his brother, Minalcar's father Calmacil, succeeded instead. Calmacil was King in name only, for he allowed his illustrious son to continue to rule as Regent. On the death of his father ten years later, the man who had actually been ruling Gondor for the previous sixty-four years finally became its true King, under his famous name R?endacil II.
 R?endacil II ruled as Regent for sixty-four years and as King of Gondor for a further sixty-two years. He was succeeded by his son Valacar.

 A city and important port on the eastern coasts of N?enor. It was included in the royal region known as Arandor, the Kingsland.


* Roper Gamgee
The first of the Gamgees.
 A name given to Hobson the son of Hob Gammidge. He followed in his father's work as a roper in Tighfield, and so was given the name Roper Gamgee ('Gamgee' being a corruption of his father's nickname 'Gammidgy'). He handed the family name down to his son Hamfast, and his grandson Samwise.


* Rorimac 'Goldfather' Brandybuck|Rorimac Brandybuck
Master of Buckland at the time of Bilbo's Birthday Party.
 The son of Gorbadoc Brandybuck, who inherited the title of Master of Buckland from his father. He was present at Bilbo's famous Birthday Party, and indeed was noted as being the first to suspect that Bilbo's disappearance at that party meant that 'Mad Baggins' had gone off on another adventure. He was nearly a hundred years old at that time (being commonly known as 'Old Rory'), and he lived for another seven years. The title 'Master of Buckland' passed on to his elder son Saradoc, and in time to his grandson Meriadoc of the Company of the Ring.


* Rose
The youngest daughter of Holman the greenhanded, who married Cotman and founded the Cotton family.


* Rose Cotton

* Royal House of Gondor
Descendants of the rulers of the South-kingdom.
 The extended house of the nobles and royalty of Gondor, descended from its first Kings. The house included the Kings of Gondor and their heirs, of course, but also their siblings and their descendants. On several occasions, the direct line of descent failed in Gondor, and other members of the house were called on to take up the Kingship. Most notable among these was Meneldil himself, the first King to rule Gondor in his own right, who took up the throne on the death of his uncle Isildur.
 There are examples of members of the Royal House being granted important military roles. For example, the great Gondorian general E?nil was a member of the Royal House, being a descendant of Telumehtar, great-grandfather to the reigning King Ondoher. Indeed, when Ondoher and his heirs were lost, E?nil eventually succeeded to the Kingship himself.
 One important political role, however, was closed to members of the Royal House: that of Steward. When R?endacil I created the Stewardship, he specified that no member of the House should ever take the role. The descendants of the House of H?in, who would eventually take on the hereditary Stewardship of the realm, were noted as being of high N?en?ean blood, but they were not members of the Royal House itself.

* Sack of Nargothrond
The destruction of the halls on the Narog.
 Since its foundation by Finrod, the Elves of Nargothrond had pursued a secretive war against Morgoth, hunting their enemies by stealth and ambush rather than going to open war. When T?in was led there by Gwindor, though, he counselled a different strategy to Orodreth, who had by that time succeeded his brother Finrod as King in Nargothrond. Orodreth therefore built a bridge from his doors across the Narog, and went to open war with Morgoth.
 This was a foolhardy strategy. In centuries of searching, Morgoth had been unable to find the fortress of Nargothrond, but now not only was its location revealed, but the new bridge removed the defence of the River Narog. Glaurung was sent out from Angband with an army of Orcs to capture the city.
 The army of Nargothrond went out to meet Glaurung on the field of Tumhalad, some miles north of the citadel. They were routed, and those Elves left in the city awaiting their return, instead found the Dragon and his Orcs crossing their bridge and entering the citadel. These people, including Orodreth's daughter Finduilas, were captured by the Orcs and driven northward.
 Coming late to the sack were T?in and some few other survivors of the Battle of Tumhalad. At the sight of the Dragon, T?in's companions fled, but T?in himself was placed under Glaurung's dragon-spell, and forced to watch as the captives were driven away. Then Glaurung released T?in, knowing the evils this would cause, and settled to enjoy his newly-sacked domain.


* Sackville Family
A little-known family of the Shire-hobbits.

* Saruman|White Messenger
'Man of Skill', the name among Men of Curun? (which it translates), one of the Istari (Wizards) and the head of their order. See Curumo, Curun?.
-----
The White wizard, traitor to the White Council.
 Most often called Saruman the White, Saruman was the first of the five Wizards to arrive in Middle-earth, at the end of the first millennium of the Third Age. He was said to be the eldest of the order, and Gandalf acknowledged him as the chief of the Istari.
 For a thousand years, and maybe more, he journeyed in the East of Middle-earth, and was little heard of in the West. He had returned, though, by III 2463, for he was present at the foundation of the Council of the Wise, and was made their chief (though both Elrond and Galadriel would have preferred Gandalf to take this position).
 It was at about this time that Saruman began to study the Rings of Power, their history and the means of their making.
 In III 2759, he was given the keys of Orthanc by Steward Beren of Minas Tirith, and took up his abode there. He continued his researches into ring-lore, and the making of devices, and was accustomed to watch the stars from the pinnacle of the Tower. He visited Minas Tirith to research the history of the Rings, and found among the ancient books and scrolls the story of the death of Isildur and the loss of the Ruling Ring.
 In III 2851, the Council discovered proof that the Necromancer of Dol Guldur was indeed Sauron returned. Many of the Wise wished to attack the fortress and drive Sauron out, but Saruman spoke against this, and dissuaded the Council from mounting an assault. It was only after ninety years had passed that he relented and aided the Council in assailing Dol Guldur, driving Sauron back into Mordor. Saruman's knowledge was vital in this victory, as Gandalf said - 'it was by the devices of Saruman that we drove him from Dol Guldur'.
 When the Council debated the Rings of Power, Saruman claimed that his researches showed that the One Ring had been lost forever. It was later shown that he did not believe this, however, and was searching for it himself, having secretly rebelled against the Council.
 He built an army of Wolves and Orcs of his own within the ring of Isengard to challenge both Sauron and the Wise, and took control of the only nearby power, the country of Rohan, through his agent Gr?a Wormtongue.
 In July, III 3018, when he was ready to reveal himself, Saruman set a trap for Gandalf, using the Wizard Radagast to lure him to Orthanc. When Gandalf came, Saruman revealed that he had made a Ring of his own, and that he was no longer Saruman the White, but claimed the title Saruman of Many Colours. When Gandalf refused to join him, he was imprisoned on the pinnacle of the Tower of Orthanc - Saruman hoped to gain the secret of the One Ring from him, or at least prevent Gandalf from using it himself.


* Sauron
'The Abhorred' (in Sindarin called Gorthaur); greatest of the servants of Melkor, in his origin a Maia of Aul? See Annatar, Artano, Aulendil.
-----
The Second Dark Lord.
 Originally a Maia of Aul?s people, Sauron was early corrupted by Melkor and became his most trusted lieutenant. In the Wars of Beleriand, Sauron was the most feared of Morgoth's servants, but after the War of Wrath and the expulsion of the first Dark Lord, Sauron rose to become the greatest enemy of Elves and Men in the Second and Third Ages.
-----
Sauron's History Before the First Age: Sauron was one of the mightiest (perhaps the mightiest) of the Maiar, and in the beginning of days he served Aul?the Smith. From Aul?he learnt much of forging and making, knowledge that he would make use of many thousands of years later when he built the Barad-d? and forged the One Ring.
 In the earliest days, Melkor seduced Sauron and took him to his own service, and Sauron became the greatest and most trusted of his followers. While Utumno still stood in the dark north of the world, Sauron was given command of his lesser fortress of Angband. At length, the Valar assaulted Melkor and took him in chains back to Valinor, but Sauron escaped, and remained in Middle-earth.
-----
Sauron in the First Age: While Melkor was captive in Aman, Angband was made ready for his return, and it must be assumed that Sauron had a large part in this work. After the Darkening of Valinor, Melkor returned indeed to Middle-earth, and took up his abode in Angband. Soon after, he travelled for a while into the eastern lands to seek the newly-awakened Men, and once again left Sauron in command of his forces.
 Though Sauron doubtless continued his evil works in the service of his lord, we hear nothing of these for many centuries after the return of Morgoth, until the days after the Dagor Bragollach. For two years after the Dagor Bragollach itself, Finrod's tower of Minas Tirith had guarded the Pass of Sirion against Morgoth's forces. In I 457, Sauron himself came against the tower; he cast a spell of fear upon the Elves who held it, and they were slain or fled back to Finrod in Nargothrond.
 Sauron then took Minas Tirith to dwell in, and watched the Pass of Sirion himself from its topmost tower. The isle on which it stood, which had been called Tol Sirion, was renamed Tol-in-Gaurhoth, the Isle of Werewolves.
 After the Dagor Bragollach, the last remnant of the House of B?r became a scattered people. Barahir, its lord, took shelter in the uplands of Dorthonion at Tarn Aeluin with his son Beren and eleven others, and was hidden for a while from Morgoth. Sauron was sent to find and destroy this desperate band of outlaws. This he did by capturing Gorlim, one of Barahir's followers, and using his sorcery he discovered the outlaws' camp, and destroyed all of Barahir's band but his son Beren.
 Beren himself fled southwards through the treacherous paths of the Ered Gorgoroth, and Sauron's army of werewolves failed to capture him. Fate drove Beren into Sauron's hands eventually, though: some years later as a he travelled through the with on the Quest of the Silmaril, Sauron captured him with Finrod and their companions and imprisoned them in Tol-in-Gaurhoth.
 Sauron knew nothing of Beren's quest; sensing some danger to himself or his master, he sent wolves out throughout the lands of the Elves, and meanwhile he flung Beren, Finrod and their companions into a deep pit. There they were devoured one after the other by one of his werewolves, and eventually all were lost but Beren. As the werewolf slew Finrod, though, L?hien came upon Sauron's Isle with Huan, the Hound of Valinor. Sauron sent wolf after wolf to investigate L?hien's song, and each was slain in turn by Huan.
 At last, he sent Draugluin, the mightiest wolf that had then lived, and he too was mortally wounded by Huan, but with his dying breath he returned to Sauron and warned him of the danger.
 So Sauron went himself to one of his greatest defeats. He took the form known as Wolf-Sauron, the shape of a mighty werewolf, and went out to meet his foes. First, he attacked L?hien, but under her enchantment he stumbled, and Huan sprang upon him. Though he shifted shape and struggled, he could not escape; at last he yielded the tower to L?hien and Huan released him. He fled eastward then to Dorthonion, where he dwelt in the dark pine forests of Taur-nu-Fuin.
-----
Sauron in the Second Age: After the War of Wrath and the defeat of his master Morgoth, Sauron fled for a time into the east of the world.3 A period of one thousand years followed in which Sauron was not seen in the west of Middle-earth. As the first millennium of the Second Age turned, Sauron came back. He took the fenced and mountainous land of Mordor, and there began building his mighty Dark Tower of Barad-d?.
 The beginning of Sauron's reign as Dark Lord can be dated from this time: he set himself no less a goal than the conquest of Middle-earth, and perhaps even of N?enor itself.
 For six hundred years, he pursued a dual strategy. In the guise of Annatar, the Lord of Gifts, he tutored the Elves of Eregion, teaching them the secret things that only a Maia of Aul?s people could know. From his lore, the Rings of Power were forged, but while he worked with the Elves, he continued the fortification of Mordor to make it an unassailable stronghold.
 In the fire-mountain of Orodruin, he secretly forged the One Ring. This was to be the first stroke in his conquest of the west - a device by which he could know, and control, the thoughts of the bearers of the other Rings. His plan failed, though: the Elves became aware of his malevolent presence, and took off their Rings.
 Angered by this setback, Sauron loosed the hordes of Mordor, six hundred years in the building, and overran Eriador, destroying the land of Eregion where the Rings were made. The Elves called on N?enor for aid, though, and the army of Tar-Minastir put Sauron's forces to rout. After this reverse, Sauron sought instead to build power in the eastern countries, and left the Westlands in peace for many centuries.
 When Ar-Pharaz? usurped the throne of N?enor in II 3255, he saw Sauron's growing eastern kingdom as a threat. Building and equipping a mighty fleet, he sailed for Middle-earth, and landed at Umbar, to the south of the Mouths of Anduin. Ar-Pharaz? demanded that Sauron submit to his authority and, seeing that the might of the N?en?eans far outstripped his own, Sauron agreed.
-----
The Shapes of Sauron: All of the Ainur had the ability to change their form, but none held so many different shapes as Sauron. During the First Age, his accustomed form seems to have been that of a dark sorceror, commanding a host of evil things, and especially werewolves and their kind. He shifted form many times in his existence, though, especially during his duel with Huan; among the shapes he wore were:
- Wolf-Sauron. This was the monstrous wolf-shape he chose when he went forth from his fortress on Tol-in-Gaurhoth to battle with Huan.
- During the battle, he changed his form to that of a serpent in his struggles to escape.
- Finally, after Huan released him, he became a great vampire, and fled into the east, 'dripping blood from his throat upon the trees'.


* Sauron's Isle
The island of Tol-in-Gaurhoth.
 A name for Tol Sirion during the period of roughly ten years that it was under the command of Sauron.


* Scatha the Worm|Scatha
A mighty Long-worm of the Grey Mountains.
 One of the greatest of the dragons to infest the Grey Mountains of the north. Of his life little is known, except that he was slain by Fram son of Frumgar (an ancestor of Eorl the Young) in the early days of the ?th?d.
 His recovered hoard was the subject of great dispute between the Men of the ?th?d and the Dwarves of that region, who claimed the hoard as their own. Fram rebuked their claim, and sent them the teeth of the dragon, with the words, 'Jewels such as these you will not match in your treasuries, for they are hard to come by'. Thereafter there was war between the ?th?d and the Dwarves, and Fram was said to have been slain by them.
 However this dispute was resolved (we are not told), it seems that Fram's people retained at least some of the hoard, and brought it south with them when they settled in Rohan. The horn that ?wyn gave to Merry Brandybuck after the War of the Ring (many hundred years later) was said to come from it.


* Sceptre
Royal symbol of the D?edain.
 The symbol of Kingship to the N?en?eans and their descendants.


* Sceptre of Ann?inas|Sceptre of Annuminas
The token of royalty in the North-kingdom.
 A silver rod, originally the symbol of office of the Lords of And?i?in N?enor. It survived the Downfall, and was held by the Kings of Arnor while that realm lasted. After the division of the North-kingdom, it was handed down through the generations of the Kings of Arthedain and their descendants, the Chieftains of the D?edain.


* Scroll of Isildur
Isildur's own account of the Ring.
-----
"... there lies in Minas Tirith still, unread, I guess, by any save Saruman and myself since the kings failed, a scroll that Isildur made himself."
(Words of Gandalf; The Fellowship of the Ring II 2, The Council of Elrond)
-----
A scroll made by Isildur himself during his short time in Minas Tirith after the War of the Last Alliance, that was stored for millennia in the vaults of that city. The scroll held Isildur's account of the gaining of the Ring from Sauron. His description of the Ring, and his account of the fiery writing that ran around it, was vital in helping Gandalf identify Frodo's Magic Ring as the One Ring of Sauron.


* Sea-elves|Sea-elf|Sea Elves|Sea Elf
A name for those Teleri who dwelt on the shores of Aman.
 A name of the Teleri, and especially those of that kin who came to Aman and dwelt at Alqualond? for their love of the sea and reverence of Ulmo its lord.


* Seal of the Stewards
The emblem of the Stewards of Gondor.
 The seal of the Stewards of Gondor, consisting of the letters R텻D톀 below three stars. The letters represent the word Arandur. This is the actual Elvish title, literally meaning 'King's Servant', that Tolkien renders into English as 'Steward'.
 When the twelfth Steward, Cirion, sent north to Eorl for aid in his desperate wars, he sent the Seal with each of six riders. Only one of these, named Borondir, succeeded in reaching the nation of the ?th?d, but from this came the famous Ride of Eorl and the foundation of Rohan.


* Second Age
The Age of N?enor.
 Beginning in about the 584th year since the Return of the Noldor to Middle-earth, the Second Age is the longest of the chronicled Ages. It began after the destruction of Beleriand in the War of Wrath, the founding of Lindon and the creation of N?enor.
 The Second Age was the Age of N?enor; the great island kingdom was created and peopled by the descendants of the Edain in the first years of the Age, and as the years passed, their power grew until it surpassed that of any nation of Men, before or since. They sailed east, exploring Middle-earth and founding great cities there. Eventually, their power and pride became so great that they challenged the Valar themselves, and were destroyed.
 The end of N?enor was not the end of the Second Age, though; a remnant of the N?enoreans led by Elendil escaped its wreck and founded kingdoms in Middle-earth; Arnor in the north and Gondor in the south. They formed a mighty alliance, the Last Alliance of Elves and Men, and marched on Sauron, who had grown great again, assailing the Dark Tower of Barad-d?. With the first overthrow of Sauron by the Alliance, the Second Age came to its end.
-----

* Second People
A name given by the Elves to the race of Men; the literal meaning of both the Quenya word Atani and the Sindarin Edain.


* Secondborn
The Younger Children of Il?atar, Men.


* Secret Fire
The fire at the heart of the World.
-----
"Therefore Il?atar gave to their vision Being, and set it amid the Void, and the Secret Fire was sent to burn at the heart of the World; and it was called E?"
(Valaquenta)
-----
A mysterious power, never explained in detail, that seems to represent the principle of existence and creation. Little can be said of it for certain, though it seems to be identified with, or at least connected to, the Flame Imperishable of Il?atar. When Gandalf met the Balrog on the Bridge of Khazad-d?, he spoke of himself as a servant of the Secret Fire. It has been conjectured that these words referred to his fire-ring Narya, but it seems unlikely that he would reveal this to a bitter enemy. More plausibly, Gandalf's words identify him as a servant of the power of Il?atar.


* Seeing-stones|Seeing-stone|Seeing stones|Seeing stone
A name for the Palant?i.
 The powerful orbs known as the palant?i made in ancient days by the Elves in Aman, and indeed said to have been the work of F?nor himself. In appearance they were dark, perfectly smooth globes of various capabilities and sizes; some were small and portable, others so huge that they could not be lifted by a Man.
 The Elves gave certain of these stones to the N?en?eans, and seven of these N?en?ean stones were rescued from the Downfall of that island by Elendil and his sons. So these seven were brought to Middle-earth, and the D?edain set them up at distant points in their lands: at Amon S?, Elostirion and Ann?inas in the north, and at Osgiliath, Orthanc, Minas Anor and Minas Ithil in the south. The chief stone of the north was that of Amon S?, lost with Arvedui in the cold northern seas. The greatest of the southern stones stood beneath the Dome of Stars in Osgiliath, and was lost during the Kin-strife.
 During the Third Age, three of the stones were known to have been lost (Arvedui also had the Stone of Ann?inas with him when he was lost at sea). The Ithil-stone was captured by Sauron and almost certainly destroyed in the Downfall of Barad-d?, and the palant? of Elostirion in the Tower Hills was taken back into the West on the Ring-bearers' White Ship. At the beginning of the Fourth Age, then, there were just two Seeing-stones left in Middle-earth, the Anor-stone and the Orthanc-stone.
 The Seeing-stones of Middle-earth were not the only palant?i to exist. Many remained with the Elves in Aman, including the so-called Master-stone held in the Tower of Avall??on Tol Eress?. Indeed, it was said that, before the stone was removed from the Tower Hills, it could be used to look along the Straight Road to the Undying Lands themselves.

* Seven Rings of the Dwarves|Seven Rings|The Seven
The Rings of the Dwarf-lords.
 Those of the Rings of Power that Sauron gave to the Dwarves to seduce them to his service. The Dwarves proved too hardy to be lured in this way, though, and the Rings did little more than increase their native lust for gold. By the end of the Third Age, Sauron had recovered three of the Seven Rings to himself, and the other four had been consumed by dragons.


* Seven Rivers of Ossir
The River Gelion and its six tributaries.
 Seven rivers that flowed through Ossiriand, the land of the Green-elves west of the Blue Mountains. The most important of these was the Gelion, which flowed from the March of Maedhros in the far north, and formed the western border of Ossiriand.
 The other six rivers were tributaries of this large river, each stemming from a separate spring in the Blue Mountains, and flowing westward to empty into the Gelion. The northernmost of these was the Ascar, which rose in the mountains near Nogrod, and flowed beside the Dwarf-road to Sarn Athrad. South from the Ascar were the Thalos, the Legolin, the Brilthor and the Duilwen. Finally, the southernmost of the six was the River Adurant, in which the green island of Tol Galen stood.


* Seven Stones
The Seeing-stones of the Realms in Exile.
 The Palant?i, the seven Seeing-stones rescued from the wreck of N?enor and brought to Middle-earth by Elendil and his sons.


* Seventh Gate
The Last Gate of Gondolin.

The bulwark of Hithlum.
 A name for and translation of Ered Wethrin, the mountain chain that walled Dor-l?in, Mithrim and Hithlum to the north of Beleriand. They are more commonly referred to as the Mountains of Shadow.

In the War of the Last Alliance, Elendil fell, and his sword was broken, but its remains were brought to the North-kingdom. These shards were carried by Elendil's heirs throughout the Third Age, as a token of their ancestry, until the time of the War of the Ring. The shards were reforged by the smiths of Rivendell into Aragorn's sword And?il.


* Sharkey
A nickname for Saruman given by his servants and soldiers in Isengard and later used in the Shire during the last stages of the War of the Ring. In its origin we catch a rare glimpse of an Orkish word: shark? which is said to mean, 'old man'.


* Sharkey's Men|Sharkey's Man|Men of Sharkey|Man of Sharkey

 A short name used by the Dwarves - in full Bundushath? - for Fanuidhol, one of the three Mountains of Moria. Its translation is presumably the same as for the Elvish version of its name, which means 'Cloudyhead'.


* Sheep
Woolly grazing animals, especially common in the N?en?ean region of Emeri? and (in Middle-earth) on the Barrow-downs and in the Vales of Anduin.


* Shelob
The great she-spider who haunted Cirith Ungol.
 A creature of spider-shape, of the spawn of Ungoliant, who dwelt in the mountains on the western borders of Mordor.


* Shelob's Lair
The dark tunnels of Cirith Ungol.
 A partial English translation of Torech Ungol, the name of the black, mazelike lair of Shelob in the pass of Cirith Ungol.


* Shepherds of the Trees
A poetic name for the Ents.
 A name of the Ents, who were created at the prayer of Yavanna to protect the forests of Middle-earth.


* Ship-king
A title given to four great Kings of Gondor.
 The title given to the great King Tarannon Falastur and his three successors: E?nil I, Ciryandil and Hyarmendacil I. These four did much to expand Gondor's naval and military might. Between them, they enormously extended the South-kingdom's control over the southern lands of Middle-earth, ncluding the lands west of the Mouths of Anduin, and as far south as Umbar and the Harad. Their influence was such that, at the end of the reign of Hyarmendacil I, Gondor had reached a peak of strength and power that it would never again surpass.


* Ship of Long-foam
The island of Cair Andros.
 A descriptive name for the long, thin eyot in the River Anduin, whose sharp northern end broke the waters of the Great River into two thin streams for a distance of some ten miles.


* Shire Calendar
The calendar in use by the Hobbits of the Shire, in which the year was divided into twelve months of thirty days each, with five additional days to make up a full 365-day year.


* Shire-folk
A common term for the Hobbits who lived in the Shire.


* Shire-hobbits
The Halflings of the Shire.
 The Hobbits of the Shire; the descendants and followers of Marcho and Blanco, the two Bree-hobbits who founded the Shire. Among the Shire-hobbits were representatives of each of the three main types of Hobbit, the Stoors, Harfoots and Fallohides.
 Shire-hobbits were considered the most rustic and pastoral of their kind, even by other Hobbits (such as those of Bree or Buckland). The most important family among the Shire-hobbits were the Tooks of the Westfarthing, who had held the hereditary, and largely honorary, title of Thain from III 2340.


* Shire-reckoning
The count of years according to the Shire-hobbits.
 The system of reckoning dates unique to the Hobbits of the Shire, based on the founding of that land in III 1601. The Shire-hobbits reckoned this as year 1. So, years of the Third Age can be converted to Shire-years by subtracting 1600 (e.g. the Downfall of Barad-d? occurred in III 3019, but in the Shire this was counted as the year 1419).
 The Shire-folk took no account of the change of Age in III 3021. While the other peoples of Middle-earth considered this to be the first year of the Fourth Age, in the Shire it was simply 1421.


* Shire-thain
Titular leader of the Shire-hobbits.
 For nearly four hundred years after its foundation, the Shire had been part of the lands of Arthedain, and under the rule of that land's King. Ultimately, Arthedain fell to the forces of Angmar, and its last King, Arvedui, was lost, leaving the Shire-hobbits without a ruler. They remedied this by choosing a new leader from among themselves, Bucca of the Marish, who was given the title thain, a word simply meaning 'chief'.
 Bucca and his descendants, a family known as the Oldbucks, served as Shire-thain for twelve generations. The twelfth Thain, one Gorhendad Oldbuck, left the Shire and crossed the River Brandywine to found Buckland. With his departure, the Thainship passed to a new line, the Tooks, and specifically to Isumbras Took I.
 From Isumbras I, the line of the Took Shire-thains continued unbroken to the time of the War of the Ring and beyond. The last recorded Thain was Faramir Took I, the thirty-fourth to hold the title of Shire-thain. The fact that both he and his father Peregrin Took are recorded as the first of that name shows that there must have been more Thains after this time, and the tradition clearly lasted well into the Fourth Age.


* Shirebourn
A southern river of the Shire.
 A lesser river of the Shire's Eastfarthing, whose name means simply 'Shire-stream'. Its source was in the uplands of the Green Hill Country, from where it flowed south and then southeast. At Willowbottom, it met the Thistle Brook, and then flowed eastwards until the Shirebourn itself met the Brandywine.
 The Shirebourn flowed into the Brandywine beneath Deephallow, and at its mouth formed the boggy region known as the Overbourn Marshes, opposite the southern end of the High Hay.


* Shirriffs|Shirriff
The Shire's 'police'.
 The title given to those who kept order in the Shire, somewhat akin to a 'police force'. Normally few in number, the Shirriffs were greatly increased during the time of the War of the Ring.


* Sickle of the Valar
The Valacirca, the seven stars set in the sky by Varda as an enduring warning to Melkor and his servants.


* Sickly
Engwar, a name for Men among the Elves.
 A name given by the Elves to the race of Men, Engwar in their tongue, referring to the fact that Men suffered illness and age, which the Elves did not.


* Siege of Angband
The leaguer of the Noldor around the fortress of Morgoth in the early centuries of the First Age. The Siege was broken in the Dagor Bragollach.


* Siege of Barad-d?|Siege of Barad-dur
Prelude to the victory of the Last Alliance.
 The siege of Sauron's Dark Tower by the forces of the Last Alliance at the end of the Second Age. Gil-galad, Elendil and Elendil's son An?ion all lost their lives in the Siege, but ultimately Sauron was defeated and the Barad-d? thrown down, at least for a time.


* Sigismond Took
A grandson of Gerontius, the Old Took, and the grandfather of Fredegar 'Fatty' Bolger.


* Silent Hill
The Beacon-hill of Amon D?.
 Amon D?, the oldest of the beacon-hills of Gondor and the nearest to Minas Tirith.


* Silent Street
Minas Tirith's street of tombs.
 Rath D?en, the street that ran between Minas Tirith and Mindolluin, on which lay the tombs of the Kings and Stewards of Gondor.


* Silmari?|Silmarien
Daughter of Tar-Elendil, the fourth King of N?enor; mother of Valandil first lord of And?i?and ancestress of Elendil the Tall and his sons Isildur and An?ion.
-----
Royal ancestor of the Lords of And?i?
 The daughter, and eldest child, of Tar-Elendil, fourth King of N?enor. She did not succeed her father (though later changes to the laws of N?enor would have made her Ruling Queen). Instead, she founded the line of the Lords of And?i?from which the Kings of Gondor and Arnor were descended.


* Silmarillion
'Of the Silmarils'.
 While Bilbo Baggins dwelt in Rivendell, he made use of all the resources there (including the memories of living Elves) to write four scholarly volumes bound in red leather. The first of these, the Red Book of Westmarch, was continued by Bilbo's heir, Frodo. It was copied many times, and became the original source for our modern The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.
 The Hobbits of the Shire, though, seem to have had less interest in the other three volumes, originally entitled simply Translations from the Elvish, that told the tales of the ancient First Age and the time before. Only one copy was made, in Gondor in IV 172, and this was kept at Great Smials by the Took family - it became known as the Thain's Book. It is from this copy that the modern Silmarillion comes.
 The Silmarillion, which in its own words passes 'from the high and the beautiful to darkness and ruin' actually consists of a corpus of five works, of which the Quenta Silmarillion is the central tale. These are:
- Ainulindal? the tale of the Music of the Ainur and the creation of Arda.
- Valaquenta, the tale of the Valar, in which the nature of each of the Powers is described.
- Quenta Silmarillion, the longest tale, which gives an account of the history of Arda from its beginnings until the end of the First Age.
- Akallab?h, the tale of the Second Age, which concentrates on the history of N?enor until its Downfall.
- Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age, which spans the late Second Age and the Third, telling of the forging of the Rings of Power and their history up to the War of the Ring.


* Silmarils|Silmaril
The three jewels made by F?nor before the destruction of the Two Trees of Valinor, and filled with their light.
-----
The Great Jewels.
 The three great jewels made by F?nor in Valinor, in which he locked the light of the Two Trees, Laurelin and Telperion, before their destruction. Melkor stole the jewels from F?nor's stronghold at Formenos, slaying his father Finw? and fled with them back to his fortress of Angband in the north of Middle-earth.
 F?nor swore an oath to recover the Silmarils, and many of the Noldor followed him into exile in pursuit of the jewels. So began their hopeless war against the forces of Morgoth, of which the Quenta Silmarillion (the 'Tale of the Silmarils') tells the story. During the First Age, one Silmaril alone was recovered from Morgoth's Iron Crown by Beren and L?hien, and was borne by E?endil when he sailed into the West to seek the aid of the Valar.
 By virtue of the Silmaril, it is said, E?endil reached Aman and was heard by the Valar, who sent a mighty force into Middle-earth. Morgoth was utterly defeated, and the Silmarils recovered. Maedhros and Maglor, the only two of F?nor's seven sons to survive until that War of Wrath, stole the jewels from the camp of the Valar. Their evil deeds in pursuance of the jewels, however, drove them to madness; Maedhros cast himself into a fiery chasm with one of the Silmarils, and Maglor threw the other into the depths of the sea. So only one Silmaril remains visible in the World, bound to E?endil's brow as he sails the heavens; the Morning and Evening Star.


* Silpion
A name of Telperion.


* Silvan Elves|Silvan Elf
Also called Woodland Elves. Nandorin Elves who never passed west of the Misty Mountains, but remained in the Vale of Anduin and in Greenwood the Great; see Nandor.
-----
Elves who fell away from the Great Journey.
 Long before the beginning of the First Age, the Elves of the Great Journey travelled westward through the lands of Middle-earth. Coming to the Great River Anduin and the high peaks of the Misty Mountains, some of the Elves of the clanof the Teleri fell away from the journey, and settled in the woodlands east of the Mountains. These were the original Silvan Elves, who lived on either side of the River. At this time in their history, all of this peoplestill lived close together, with some dwelling in the land that would later be called L?ien, and the others settling around the hill of Amon Lanc in the far south of Greenwood the Great.
 It must have been in the time these Elves were living closely together that the Silvan Elvish language appeared. As history passed, the Elves would move away from one another, and mingle with other Elvish peoples, so that the Silvan branch of Elvish would eventually become extinct. Nonetheless, relics of that ancient tongue survived in some well-known place-names and personal names, such as Caras Galadhon, Amroth and even L?ien itself.
 The Silvan Elves dwelt in their twin woodland realms for many centuries, but in the Second Age the emerging power of Sauron began to drive them apart. Oropher was the ruler of the Elves who dwelt in the Greenwood, and he began to seek safety by moving his people northwards, away from Amon Lanc and away from the Silvan Elves who lived to the west of theGreat River.
-----
West of Anduin - the Silvan Elves of L?ien: Unlike their cousins in the east, the Silvan Elves of L?ien remained settled in their land throughout their known history. We know little of their existence well into the Second Age, where we find them ruled by a Sindarin Elf named Amd?. After the destruction of Eregion in the middle Second Age, many of its exiles had escaped through Khazad-d? into the east, and had joined the Silvan Elves of L?ien and ultimately mingled with them.
 Amd? was lost in the wars at the end of the Second Age. In the time of his son Amroth, Durin's Bane wasunleashed in Khazad-d?. After this time, especially with the power of Sauron growing in Dol Guldur to the east, many of L?ien's people fled into the south. Amroth himself was among them, and he was drowned in the Bay of Belfalas far from his kingdom. It was at this time, a little more than a thousand years before the War of the Ring, that Galadriel and Celeborn became the Lord and Lady of L?ien.
-----
East of Anduin - the Silvan Elves of Mirkwood: The Elves of Greenwood the Great, soon to become known as Mirkwood, had a much less settled existence than their fellow Silvan Elves in the west. Their original dwellings were in the far south of the great Wood, but as Sauron's power grew, they gradually withdrew farther and farther northward. Eventually Sauron chose to settle within the Forest itself, and in fact built his fortress of Dol Guldur on the hill of Amon Lanc, where the Silvan Elves had originally dwelt. Though his identity remained secret during this time (he was known simply as the 'Necromancer') he brought darkness and shadow to Greenwood the Great, and the Elves retreated farther still.
 In the later years of the Third Age, their King Thranduil (the son of Oropher, who was slain in the War of the Last Alliance) dwelt with his people in the far northeast of Mirkwood, in underground dwellings protectedby magic. Their history of fleeing from Sauron's darkness had made them a suspicious and unwelcoming people, as Thorin and his companions discovered during the Quest of Erebor. It was from Thranduil's underground halls that his son Legolas journeyed at the end of the Third Age, to play a great part in the War of the Ring.
-----
The War of the Ring and beyond: In the War of the Ring, Sauron's forces attacked both Silvan realms. By the power of Galadriel and her Ring, L?ien was protected against three waves of assault from Dol Guldur. Thranduil had no Ring to protect his realm - it was invadedand the trees of the northern forest set alight, though he was at last able to drive back the enemy.
 With the fall of Sauron, Dol Guldur was destroyed, and Mirkwood renamed again: Eryn Lasgalen, the Wood of Greenleaves. Now the Silvan Elves once again dwelt in the south of the Wood, but these were not Thranduil's people, but Elves of L?ien, who crossed the Great River to live in a new land named East L?ien. Though the original land of L?ien faded after the passing of Galadriel and Celeborn, the Silvan Elves of the Wood lived peacefully under their trees for many long years.


* Silverlode|Silver Lode
The river the Elves called Celebrant.
 The name among Men for the river the Elves called Celebrant; it sprang from the Mirrormere in the Dimrill Dale, and flowed east through L?ien to meet the River Anduin.


* Silvertine
The Mannish name for Zirakzigil.
 One of the three peaks that made up the Mountains of Moria, above the Dwarf-city of Khazad-d?. Its Dwarvish name was Zirakzigil, while the Elves called it Celebdil.


* Sindar|Sinda
The Grey-elves; name applied to all the Elves of Telerin origin whom the returning Noldor found in Beleriand, save for the Green-elves of Ossiriand. The Noldor may have devised this name because the first Elves of this origin whom they met with were in the north, under the grey skies and mists about Lake Mithrim; or perhaps because the Grey-elves were not of the Light (of Valinor) nor yet of the Dark (Avari), but were Elves of the Twilight. But it was held to refer to Elw?s name Thingol (Quenya Sindacollo, Singollo 'Grey-cloak'), since he was acknowledged high king of all the land and its peoples. The Sindar called themselves Edhil, plural Edhel.
-----
The Grey-elves.
 An Elvish people of Telerin origin. Coming to the western shores of Middle-earth with the others of their kin, they did not pass across the sea, but remained in Beleriand. Some had tarried there searching for their lord, Elw? while others were persuaded to remain by Oss?the Maia.
 Before the return of the Noldor to Middle-earth, the Sindar were found in most parts of Beleriand; all claimed Elw?(known as Thingol in the Sindarin tongue) as their high king. There were two main countries of the Sindar, however; in Doriath under the rule of Thingol and Melian, and in the Falas, under the lordship of C?dan the Shipwright.
 The name means 'Grey People' (from the name of their King, Thingol Greycloak).
-----
Before the Return of the Noldor: For two ages, the Sindar dwelt in peace and plenty; they roamed throughout Beleriand, from the shorelands of the Falas in the west to the Blue Mountains in the east, and all owned Thingol as their lord and king.
 In the third age of the Captivity of Melkor (that is, the last age of the Years of the Trees), evil things that had dwelt east of the Blue Mountains began to trouble the Sindar. At this time, they first considered the need for weapons and armour, which they had not needed before. They traded with the Dwarves of Nogrod and Belegost, and learned smithcraft from them. Thus armed, they drove the invading wolves and Orcs and other foul things from their land and had peace again, for a time.


* Sindarin
Of or pertaining to the Sindar.


* Sindarin (language)|Sindarin
The Elvish tongue of Beleriand, derived from the common Elvish speech but greatly changed through long ages from Quenya of Valinor; acquired by the Noldorin exiles in Beleriand. Called also the Grey-elven tongue, the tongue of the Elves of Beleriand, etc.
-----
The tongue of the Grey-elves.
 The language of the Grey-elves of Beleriand and most commonly used of the Elf-tongues in Middle-earth. When the Noldor returned to Middle-earth at the beginning of the First Age, Thingol decreed that their tongue, Quenya, was not to be spoken in his realms. So the language of his people, Sindarin, came to dominate. Quenya, though, was still used as a language of ceremony and poetry.
 Sindarin shared common roots with Quenya, and the two languages had many similar words. Sindarin was said to be more changeful than the older tongue, however, and there were a number of regional 'dialects' of the tongue. The Sindarin spoken in Doriath was said to be the highest and most noble form of the language.
 The word Sindarin means '(Language) of the Grey People'.


* Singollo|Sindacollo
'Grey-cloak', 'Grey-mantle'; see Thingol. Called also Sindacollo.
-----
An old form of the name Thingol.
 An ancient surname, meaning 'Greycloak', of Elw? brother of Olw?and lord of the Sindar. It is better known in its later Sindarin form, Thingol.


* S? Angren|Sir Angren|Angren
Sindarin name of the Isen. See Athrad Angren.
-----
The Elvish name for the River Isen.
 The older, Elvish name for the river much better known by the name the Rohirrim gave it - the Isen. Both names have the same meaning; 'the iron river'.


* S? Ninglor|Sir Ninglor|Ninglor
The Elves' name for the Gladden River.
 The Sindarin name of the river called the Gladden by Men, meaning 'River Goldwater'.


* Sirannon
The gate-stream of old Khazad-d?, that flowed from its westward walls into Eregion. Its precise course is unknown, but it was presumably a tributary of the River Glanduin.


* Siril
The chief river of N?enor, flowing southwards from the Meneltarma.
-----
The major river of the island of N?enor.
 The greatest of the few rivers on the island of N?enor; it rose in the valleys beneath the Meneltarma, and flowed directly southwards to come to the sea at the fishing port of Nindamos, on the borders of the Hyarnustar and the Hyarrostar.


* Sirion
The 'Great River' of Beleriand, flowing from north to south and dividing West from East Beleriand.
-----
The great river of Beleriand.
 The greatest of the rivers of Beleriand, the Sirion flowed some 850 miles from its source in the cold highlands of the Ered Wethrin to its mighty delta on the Bay of Balar. It was unusual in that, for some nine miles of its middle course, it flowed underground from the wide, enchanted marshland of Aelin-uial beneath the high land known as the Andram. The Sirion was regarded as the border between East and West Beleriand.


* Siriondil
The eleventh of Gondor's Kings, who succeeded his father King Atanatar I during the waning years of the Third Age's first millennium. We know almost nothing of his reign, which seems to have been a peaceful one. He was succeeded by his illustrious son Tarannon Falastur, the first of the line of four Ship-kings.


* Sirith
The river that met the Anduin at Pelargir.
 A Gondorian river that rose in the White Mountains in eastern Lebennin, and flowed southward. At the point where it met the Great River Anduin, the port of Pelargir stood.


* Skinbark
One of the oldest of Ents.
 With Treebeard and Leaflock, one of the three oldest Ents of Fangorn Forest. He lived on the slopes above and to the west of Isengard, and so he and his people suffered the most at the hands of Saruman's despoiling Orcs.


* Skin-changers|Skin-changer
Magical shape-changing beings.
 Creatures who could take different forms at will. Little is known of their abilities; the only skin-changers identified by Tolkien were Beorn and his descendants (who could take the shape of a Man or of a bear), but evidently other skin-changers existed.


* Smaug
The great Dragon of Erebor. Called also simply 'the Dragon'.
-----
The Dragon of Erebor.
-----
"My armour is like tenfold shields, my teeth are swords, my claws spears, the shock of my tail a thunderbolt, my wings a hurricane, and my breath death!"
(Smaug's description of himself, from The Hobbit 12, Inside Information).
-----
Smaug was the last of the great fire-drakes, and said to be the greatest dragon of his time. At some time during the twenty-eighth century of the Third Age, he came to hear of the immense wealth held by the Dwarves of Erebor. Where he came from we do not know for certain, but in the year III 2770 he descended in fire on the Lonely Mountain, destroying the Dwarf-kingdom and the nearby township of Dale.
 Gathering together the treasures of the Dwarves, he formed himself an immense bed of gold and jewels and settled within the ruined halls of Erebor. Slowly the years and decades passed, until the people of the Long Lake to the south had almost forgotten the Dragon of Erebor and Smaug imagined himself unassailable.
 Then, one day in the October of III 2941, one hundred and seventy-one years after his arrival in Erebor, Smaug awoke to find his treasure disturbed. Of all that mountain of wealth, he noticed with rage that a single two-handled cup had been taken. He could not have imagined that the loss of that cup signalled his own imminent downfall; Thorin, the heir of the King under the Mountain that Smaug had driven from his halls those many years before, had returned to reclaim his kingdom. With him came Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit with a magical Ring with which he had invisibly removed that single cup from Smaug's treasure.
 In his anger, the dragon flew from his halls, scorching and breaking the mountainside. Thorin, Bilbo and their companions were sealed in a hidden tunnel, and at last the frustrated Smaug gave up his attack on the mountain. Realizing that they must have had help from Lake-town to the south, he set out to punish the Men of the Lake instead.
 That was to be Smaug's last flight. Bilbo had managed to discover an open patch in the dragon's armour, and word of this had been carried to Lake-town. In particular, it reached the heir of another of Smaug's victims, Bard, the descendant of Girion of Dale. Bard shot Smaug with an arrow, and though Lake-town was devastated in his attack and fall, the dragon was defeated. In years to come, beneath the waters of the lake his mighty bones could be seen, and the jewels that had lined his hide: the last remains of the greatest dragon of his age.


* Sm?gol|Smeagol
The hobbit-like creature who became Gollum.
 A Hobbit of Stoor-kind who lived on the banks of the Anduin in the later Third Age. His friend D?gol came upon the One Ring, but Sm?gol murdered D?gol and took the Ring. He was eventually exiled by his people, and crept into the roots of the Misty Mountains, where he became the creature of the dark better known as Gollum.


* Smials|Smial
The Hobbits' name for their holes.
 The term the Hobbits themselves used for their excavated dwellings, more usually called simply 'hobbit-holes'.


* Snaga
A name for lesser Orcs.
 A contemptuous term for the lesser Orcs of Mordor and Isengard, used especially among the larger and stronger Uruk-hai. It comes from a word in the Black Speech meaning 'slave'.


* Snails|Snail
Spiral-shelled molluscs.
 Shell-bearing gastropod molluscs. Those of Erebor were particularly noted for their large size.


* Snakes|Snake
Reptilian creatures that are universally associated in Tolkien with the forces of darkness, and especially with Morgoth, the first Dark Lord.


* Snow-trolls|Snow-troll|Snow Trolls|Snow Troll
Trolls that lived among the ice and snow.
 Trolls adapted for life among snow and ice. No Snow-troll appears in Tolkien's work, but we can infer their existence from the fact that Helm Hammerhand is compared to one of these creatures during his sorties against the Dunlendings during the Long Winter.


* Snowbourn
River rising under the Starkhorn and fowing out down Harrowdale and past Edoras.
-----
The river that flowed out of Harrowdale.
 A river of Rohan; it rose beneath the Starkhorn in the northern White Mountains, and flowed past the courts of Edoras as it flowed north and east to meet the River Entwash among the grassy plains of Eastfold.


* Snowmane
The swift horse of Th?den.
 The steed of Th?den, King of Rohan, on which he rode to the Battle of the Pelennor, and beneath which he fell in that battle.


* Solmath
The second month of the Shire Calendar. Approximately equivalent to modern February, it in fact ran from our 22 January to 20 February.


* Sons of F?nor|Sons of Feanor
Seven Elf-lords driven by the Oath of their father.
 The seven Noldorin Elves who took the Oath of F?nor with their father, and pursued it after his death in the Dagor-nuin-Giliath. They held lands in East Beleriand, with Maedhros and Maglor holding the immediate passes south of Lothlann, and the other brothers ruling lands behind their guard to the south.
 F?nor's sons were in general allied with the other Elves of Beleriand against the power of Morgoth. After the recovery of one of the Great Jewels by Beren and L?hien, however, the Oath of their father came into action, and they fell upon the other Elves in hope of retrieving the Silmaril. They attacked Dior in Doriath, and the Exiles at the Mouths of Sirion, but neither of these forays gained them the Jewel; it was borne into the West by E?endil.
 At the time of the War of Wrath, only two of the seven sons remained; Maedhros and Maglor. They stole the last two Silmarils from the camp of E?w? but their evil deeds in recovering them meant that the hallowed Jewels rejected their claimants. Maedhros in anguish threw himself into a fiery fissure, and Maglor in despair cast his Jewel into the Great Sea.


* Sorcerer
A title of Sauron, and of his greatest servant.
 At the time of Sauron's secret re-emergence in the heart of Mirkwood, he was referred to as 'the Sorcerer' or, in full, 'the Sorcerer of Dol Guldur'. Sauron's servant, the Lord of the Nazg?, followed his master, and before the Battle of the Pelennor Gandalf also gave this title to him.


* Sorontil
'Eagle-horn', a great height on the coast of the northern promontory of N?enor.
-----
The northern height of N?enor.
 In all the histories and geographies of the island of N?enor, only two mountains are named. The first was the famous Meneltarma, the Pillar of Heaven that stood in the central highlands. The other was far to the north, near the island's North Cape, with its eastern flanks forming sheer sea-cliffs. That was Sorontil, the peak of the Forostar.
 Sorontil's name is never given an English form, but in translation it would be 'Eaglehorn', an appropriate name for a mountain whose crags were home to countless Eagles. In the early history of N?enor, Tar-Meneldur built a tall tower in the vicinity of this mountain, though we are not told whether this actually stood on the slopes of Sorontil itself.


* Soronto
N?en?ean, son of Tar-Aldarion's sister Ailinel and cousin of Tar-Ancalim?
-----
A nobleman of N?enor's early history.
 A descendant of the royal line of N?enor, the grandson of Tar-Meneldur and nephew of Tar-Aldarion. He lived during in the later years of the first millennium of the Second Age.


* Soron??Soronume
Name of a constellation.
-----
The eagle among the stars.
 One of the constellations that Varda traced in the sky with the dews of Telperion, before the Awakening of the Elves. Its name, which seems to mean 'eagle of the west' suggests a connection with the stars we know today as Aquila, but this is not certain.


* South Downs
Hills in Eriador south of Bree.
-----
The downlands of central Eriador.
 A range of hills that ran through the central regions of Eriador.


* South Gondor
The lands of Gondor beyond the Poros.
 The name given to the land between the Rivers Poros and Harnen. Historically this region was a part of Gondor, but frequent assaults and invasions by the Corsairs of Umbar and the Haradrim meant that, by the later years of the Third Age, Gondor's claim on this region was debatable at best.


* South Ithilien
The lands southward from the Emyn Arnen.
 The southern lands of Ithilien, from the hills of Emyn Arnen in the north to the River Poros in the south.


* South-kingdom|South Kingdom|Southern Kingdom|Kingdom of the South|Southern Realm
The southern realm of the D?edain.
 Gondor, the southern of the two kingdoms founded in Middle-earth by Elendil and his sons. The other was Arnor in the north.


* South-victor
The meaning of the name Hyarmendacil.
 The translated meaning of the Gondorian King-name Hyarmendacil. It was taken by two of Gondor's Kings to commemorate great victories over their southern enemies. Hyarmendacil I defeated the Haradrim in the twelfth century of the Third Age, while Hyarmendacil II claimed the same title some five hundred years later.


* Southern Army
Gondor's defence against the Haradrim.
 The smaller of the two armies formed by King Ondoher of Gondor, to protect his kingdom against the double threat of the Wainriders to the northeast, and the Haradrim to the south. The Captaincy of the Southern Army was given to E?nil, a descendant of the royal line of Gondor.


* Southern Star
A famous variety of pipe-weed.
 A variety of pipe-weed grown in the Southfarthing of the Shire, and apparently originating in the district around Longbottom. The 'star' of its name presumably refers to the star-shaped flowers of the pipe-weed plant.


* Southfarthing of the Shire|Southfarthing
One of the divisions of the Shire.
-----
The southern lands of the Shire-hobbits.
 The warmer southern farthing of the Shire, with its chief town being Longbottom. This was the region where most of the Shire's tobacco production was concentrated.


* Southrons|Southron
A Mannish name for the Haradrim.
 The Men of Harad, the ancient enemies of Gondor from the lands to the south.


* Spiders|Spider
Eight-legged spinners of webs.
 These small eight-legged creatures, known for capturing their prey in intricate webs, were evidently as common in Middle-earth as they are today. Characters in The Lord of the Rings often refer to them descriptively, whether it be Gandalf discussing his capture by Saruman (quoted above), Sam climbing ropes across the Silverlode, or Gollum clambering down a rock wall.
 There was a more sinister side to the spiders of Middle-earth, though, that entered it with the monstrous Ungoliant in the years before the First Age. A gigantic creature of spider-shape, it was she who destroyed the Two Trees of Valinor, and escaped with Melkor into the lands of Middle-earth. Though Ungoliant herself disappeared into the far south, she left the northern lands infested with her offspring. During the First Age, the mountains of the Ered Gorgoroth were infested with these monsters, and became a place of dread.
 The most famous of Ungoliant's children, though, lived far to the south and east of the Ered Gorgoroth, on the borders of the land of Mordor. This was Shelob, who haunted a network of tunnels watching the pass of Cirith Ungol, eking a living on the hapless Orcs of Sauron. She had offspring of her own, too, smaller than she but with a cruel intelligence, that spread throughout the Ephel D?th and north into Mirkwood. It was creatures like these that Bilbo encountered in The Hobbit, and through fighting them that his sword acquired its name Sting.


* Spring of Arda
The time when the Valar still dwelt on Almaren.
 The time, many millennia ago, when the Valar had ordered the World as they wished and rested upon Almaren, and Melkor lurked beyond the Walls of Night. The Spring was marred when Melkor returned to Arda, and ended completely when he destroyed the Lamps of the Valar.


* Springle-ring
A dance both pretty and vigorous.
 A dance of the Shire-hobbits.


* Squirrels|Squirrel
Agile creatures of Middle-earth's forests.
 Nut-eating rodents often found in trees. Most would have been red or grey, but in Mirkwood, the squirrels were said to be black in colour.


* Staddle
A village of the Bree-land, lying on the south-eastern slopes of the Bree-hill. Staddle was the main settlement of the Bree-hobbits.


* Stair Falls
The falls of the Sirannon.
 The falls beneath the West-gate of Khazad-d?, where the Gate-stream of the Sirannon made a waterfall some thirty feet in height before flowing out across the grasslands of Eregion. The falls took their name from the stair carved beside them in the rock of the cliff.


* Standelf
A small village in the southern regions of Buckland.


* Star of E?endil|Star of Earendil|Stone of E?endil|Stone of Earendil
The silmaril of L?hien. Called also the Stone of E?endil.


* Star-glass
The Phial of Galadriel.
 More commonly called the Phial of Galadriel, the Star-glass was Galadriel's parting gift to Frodo Baggins when the Company of the Ring departed from L?ien. In appearance, it was a globe of crystal that held a shimmering fragment of the light of the evening star.


* Starkhorn
The mountain at Harrowdale's head.
-----
"Immediately before the travellers the widest of these glens opened like a long gulf among the hills. Far inward they glimpsed a tumbled mountain-mass with one tall peak..."
(The Two Towers III 6, The King of the Golden Hall)
-----
A mighty snow-clad peak that rose in the inner regions of the White Mountains. From its feet prang the Snowbourn River, whose widening valley ran northwards through the mountains to emerge onto the plains of Rohan. The Rohirrim called that valley Harrowdale, and built their courts of Edoras at its mouth, from where the lonely white peak of the Starkhorn could be seen along the straight length of the valley.


* Starwards
Elenna, a name for the island of N?enor.
 Elenna, a rare name for N?enor, taken from the fact that the first Men to inhabit that island came to it by following the light of the Star of E?endil.


* Steward of Gondor|Steward
Title of the rulers of the South-kingdom after the Kings.
 Originally the honorary title of the chief counsellor to the King of Gondor. The title became hereditary from the time of Steward Pelendur of the House of H?in. After the loss of King E?nur in Minas Morgul, Mardil Voronw?became the first Ruling Steward, and his descendants ruled Gondor until the time of Denethor II, when Aragorn II Elessar was crowned as King of the Reunited Kingdom.


* Stewards' Reckoning
The Gondorian calendar of the later Third Age.
 The calendar system introduced in Gondor by Mardil Voronw? its first Ruling Steward. It survived until the end of the Third Age, and was thus the calendar in use at the time of the War of the Ring.


* Sting
The 'short sword' of Bilbo and Frodo Baggins.
 An knife manufactured in Gondolin in the First Age, carried away as spoil by the creatures of Morgoth who destroyed that city. It was rediscovered millennia later in a troll-hoard by Bilbo Baggins, who named it Sting after using it to rescue Thorin Oakenshield and his companions from the giant spiders of Mirkwood.


* Stock
A village in the Shire, at the north end of the Marish.
-----
A small town or village of the Marish, near the banks of the River Brandywine, in the Eastfarthing of the Shire.


* Stock-brook
The stream that flowed through Stock in the Shire.
 A brook of the Shire's Eastfarthing, and a minor tributary of the River Brandywine. It rose in the forested hills above Woody End, and from there flowed eastwards and a little northwards out into the fields of the Marish. It passed through the southern end of the village of Stock, from which it took its name, before emptying into the Brandywine a few miles north of Bucklebury Ferry.


* Stone of Osgiliath
The chief palant? of the South-kingdom.
 The greatest of the seven palant?i of Middle-earth was the Stone that stood in Osgiliath, the ancient capital of Gondor. For 1,500 years or more, it was held beneath the Dome of Stars that gave the city its name. While most of the palant?i were small and portable, the Stone of Osgiliath was much larger, and could not be lifted by a Man.
 The greatest of the Seeing-stones was also the first to be lost. During the early reign of Eldacar, a rebellion arose that came to be known as the Kin-strife. During this civil war, the city of Osgiliath was besieged and burned by the rebels, and the Stone was lost in the waters of the River Anduin.


* Stone of the Hapless
Memorial stone of T?in and Nienor by Cabed Naeramarth in the river Teiglin.
-----
Memorial to the family of H?in.
 The hallowed stone on the banks of the River Teiglin that commemorated T?in and Nienor, and Morwen their mother.


* Stone-giants|Stone-giant|Stone Giants|Stone Giant
Stone-hurling denizens of the Misty Mountains.
 Mighty creatures of the Misty Mountains, and perhaps elsewhere in Middle-earth. The only known reference to them occurs in The Hobbit, in which Bilbo and the Dwarves encounter them as they cross the Misty Mountains. During a storm, the Stone-giants emerge, and cast huge boulders about a rocky valley as part of a bizarre game.
 The difficulty of fitting Stone-giants (and all giants, for that matter) into Tolkien's world has led some to see the Stone-giants as a metaphor for crashing thunderbolts, or something similar. However, the detail of the Stone-giants' description, and the occurrence of other giants in Tolkien's work, makes it seem likely that these creatures actually did exist in Middle-earth.


* Stone-houses|Stone-house|Stone Houses|Stone House
A name used among the Dr?dain.
 A term of uncertain meaning, used among the Dr?dain of Dr?dan Forest in Gondor's northern lands. It seems to refer either to the Gondorians themselves, or perhaps their dwellings in the city of Minas Tirith.


* Stone-trolls|Stone-troll|Stone Trolls|Stone Troll
Lumbering creatures of the night.
 A race of Trolls in the service of Sauron. We know nothing for certain of these creatures except that they inhabited the Westlands of Middle-earth: the Trolls encountered by Bilbo Baggins and his companions on their journey to Erebor were likely of this kind.


* Stones of Seeing
A name of the palant?i, the seven stones brought out of the destruction of N?enor by Elendil and his sons.


* Stonewain Valley|Imrath Gondraich
Valley in the Dr?dan Forest at the eastern end of Ered Nimrais. The name is a translation of Imrath Gondraich.
-----
The ancient way of the quarrymen of Gondor.
 A long straight valley in the eastern White Mountains. It was made in ancient days by the Men of Gondor, as a route from the quarries beneath Nardol to Minas Anor. By the time of the War of the Ring, it was all but forgotten, but it was rediscovered in time to be used by the Rohirrim to come to the Battle of the Pelennor.


* Stoors|Stoor
The broadest and heaviest of Hobbits.
 One of the three ancient hobbit-kinds, the broadest and heaviest in build. They were the last of three branches of the Hobbits to cross the Misty Mountains into Eriador.


* Stormcrow
The harbinger of a coming storm.
 A name given to Gandalf in Rohan.


* Straight Road
The path over the Sea into the Ancient or True West, on which the ships of the Elves might still sail after the Downfall of N?enor and the Changing of the World.
-----
The pathway into the West.
 Before the Downfall of N?enor, the realm of the Gods in Valinor was still present in the world, and those Elves who wished to reach it could do so by sailing on into the West. After the Downfall, Valinor was taken away, and the World took on the round shape we know today. Mortals sailing into the West simply circled the globe and eventually returned to their starting place.
 For the Elves, however, a way was left open to return to Valinor; the Straight Road. An Elven-ship sailing into the West left the Bent World, and travelled through the air 'as it were on a mighty bridge invisible', until they came to Tol Eress? and the Undying Lands.
 The Straight Road was not entirely closed to Mortals; some by the special grace of the Valar could use it, as did the ring-bearers at the end of the Third Age. Other mortal mariners too, it was said, would sometimes find the Road and come to the shores of Aman before they died.
 It is not certain whether the Straight Road could be traversed in both directions (i.e. whether Elves of Valinor could return to Middle-earth). There are suggestions in Tolkien's unpublished writing that this may have been the case (though this is also contradicted by his later letters). It is suggested, for example, that Glorfindel of Rivendell, who appears in The Lord of the Rings, may have been the same Glorfindel who was slain in the Fall of Gondolin in The Silmarillion, returned from the halls of Mandos. Such speculations cannot be considered canonical, however, and within Arda it is assumed that the Straight Road travelled only into the West.


* Straight Way
A name for the Straight Road of the Elves.
 An occasional name for the Straight Road, by which the Elves sailed from Middle-earth and came to Aman.


* Strangers
A name of Elves for the race of Men, who dwelt in the world for only a few short years, while the Elves were bound to it until its end.


* Strawberries|Strawberry

 Wild berries found by Bilbo in the upper Vales of Anduin, as he journeyed eastward on the Quest of Erebor.


* Strawheads
Contemptuous name among the Easterlings in Hithlum for the People of Hador.


* Strider
The name of Aragorn in Bree.
-----

* Strongbow
Translation of C?halion, name of Beleg.
-----
Title and surname of Beleg, the captain of Doriath who became a companion of T?in Turambar, and whose fate it was to be slain in error by his friend.


* Stunted People
The literal meaning of the Elvish word Naugrim.
 The most common term used by the Elves to refer to the Dwarves; Naugrim in Elvish.


* S?im?Sulime
The third month of the year, according to the Stewards' Reckoning of Gondor, lying between N?im?and the feast-day of Tuil?? On a modern calendar, S?im?ran between 21 February and 22 March.


* S?imo|Sulimo
Name of Manw? rendered in the Valaquenta as 'Lord of the Breath of Arda' (literally 'the Breather').
-----
The surname of Manw?
 The title and surname given to Manw?the chief of the Valar, master of the airs and lord of birds, especially Eagles. The Elvish root-word s? that appears in this name literally means 'breath', but is also used in connection with wind and weather. For example, the Elvish name for the hill Weathertop was 'Amon S?'.


* Summerfilth
A nonsense word of the Shire-hobbits.
 A non-existent month in the Shire calendar, used jocularly in the expression 'on Friday the first of Summerfilth', to refer to a something that would never happen. After the reform of the Shire's calendar in c.III 2670, each weekday always fell on the same date, and there was no month in the calendar that ever started on a Friday.
 The name 'Summerfilth' is taken from the real month of Winterfilth (approximately equivalent to our October).

The broken blade of Elendil.
 Narsil, the sword of Elendil that broke beneath him when he fell in the War of the Last Alliance. Its shards were returned to Arnor, where they were kept as an heirloom for three thousand years. The sword was reforged as And?il, and borne by Elendil's heir Aragorn in the War of the Ring.

* Tar-Alcarin
Seventeenth Ruler of N?enor.
-----
The son of Tar-Vanimeld?
 The son and heir of Tar-Vanimeld? the third Ruling Queen of N?enor. He should have succeeded his mother, but instead his father Herucalmo withheld the Sceptre from his son, and ruled as Tar-Anducal for twenty years before his own death. Thereupon Tar-Alcarin took up his rightful Kingship, and ruled for a further eighty years. He was succeeded by his own son, Tar-Calmacil.


* Tar-Aldarion|Aldarion|Great Captain
Sixth Ruler of N?enor, the Mariner King; by the Guild of Venturers called the (Great) Captain. See Anardil.
-----
The sixth King of N?enor.
 The son of Tar-Meneldur; a great explorer and later King of N?enor.


* Tar-Amandil
The third King of N?enor.
 The grandson of Elros Tar-Minyatur. When the time came for his father Vardamir to take the Sceptre, he refused it and passed the Kingship directly to Tar-Amandil (though legally Vardamir was held to be the second King). Tar-Amandil was in turn succeeded by his son Tar-Elendil.


* Tar-An?ion|Tar-Anarion
Eighth Ruler of N?enor; son of Tar-Ancalim?and Hallacar of Hyarastorni.
-----
The eighth ruler of N?enor.
 The son of Tar-Ancalim? the first of N?enor's Ruling Queens, who ruled the island for more than a century. His two elder children were daughters, but both refused the Sceptre, and so he was succeeded by his third child and eldest son, Tar-S?ion.


* Tar-Ancalim?Ancalim?Ancalime
Seventh Ruler of N?enor and the first Ruling Queen, daughter of Tar-Aldarion and Erendis. See Emerwen.
-----
The first Ruling Queen of N?enor.
 The daughter and only child of Tar-Aldarion, the sixth King of N?enor. Aldarion caused the laws of succession to be changed, and Ancalim?succeeded him as the first of N?enor's Ruling Queens.


* Tar-Ancalimon|Ancalimon
Fourteenth King of N?enor, in whose time the N?en?eans became divided into opposed parties.
-----
Fourteenth King of N?enor.
 In the time of Tar-Ancalimon's father Tar-Atanamir, and of his grandfather Tar-Ciryatan, the N?en?eans had begun to turn against the Valar and the Eldar, and take pride in their own strength and wealth. Tar-Ancalimon continued down this path, and the histories of N?enor record that the division of the N?en?eans began in earnest during his reign.
 Politically, the realm became split between two parties, the King's Men, who followed Tar-Ancalimon's policies, and the Elendili, who favoured continued friendship with the Eldar. For the next millennium, N?enor's history was bound up with the dissent between these two parties, and ultimately the King's Men were to help bring about its destruction.
 That lay in the far future, though: during his reign, Tar-Ancalimon turned away from the traditions of the past. He discontinued the dedication to Eru, which had taken place at the Meneltarma in the middle of the island. The tradition of the taking of the Kings' names in Elvish he maintained, though, partly through fear of ill-fortune. This is perhaps because of a dark omen of Tar-Ancalimon's reign: the Eagles of Manw? who had nested in the tower of the King's palace at Armenelos since N?enor's founding, left their eyrie and never returned.
 Tar-Ancalimon died as he had lived, clinging to the last vestiges of life as his father had before him. He was succeeded by his son Tar-Telemmait? a Man greedy for riches and silver, who followed in all the ways of his father.


* Tar-Anducal
Name taken as Ruler of N?enor by Herucalmo, who usurped the throne on the death of Tar-Vanimeld?his wife.
-----
Consort to Queen Tar-Vanimeld?
 The N?en?ean king-name taken by Herucalmo, the consort of the third Ruling Queen Tar-Vanimeld? During his wife's reign, Herucalmo was the real power in the land of N?enor. After the Queen's death, he took the Kingship illegally in the name Tar-Anducal, and ruled the island kingdom for twenty years until his own death. He was succeeded by his son, the legal heir to Tar-Vanimeld?who took the throne as Tar-Alcarin.


* Tar-Ardamin
Nineteenth Ruler of N?enor, called in Ad?aic Ar-Abatt?ik.
-----
The nineteenth of N?enor's rulers.
 An uncertain figure in the histories of N?enor. In the royal lists of The Line of Elros (in Unfinished Tales of N?enor and Middle-earth), he is given as the heir and successor of Tar-Calmacil, whose name in Ad?aic was Ar-Abattar?, and who was succeeded in turn by his own son Ar-Ad?akh?. He does not appear, however, in the list of N?en?ean Kings and Queens shown in The Lord of the Rings, where the succession is shown as passing directly from Tar-Calmacil to Ar-Ad?akh?.


* Tar-Atanamir the Great|Tar-Atanamir|Atanamir
Thirteenth King of N?enor, called the Great and the Unwilling, to whom the Messengers of the Valar came.
-----

* Tar-Calion|Calion
Quenya name of Ar-Pharaz?.
-----
The Elvish form of the name Ar-Pharaz?.
 The Elvish equivalent of the name of the N?en?ean King Ar-Pharaz?. It would never have been used in his presence, but was, out of tradition, recorded in this Elvish form as the names of the ancient Kings had always been.


* Tar-Calmacil
Eighteenth Ruler of N?enor, called in Ad?aic Ar-Belzagar.
-----
The eighteenth ruler of N?enor.
 The successor to King Tar-Alcarin, who became the eighteenth ruler of N?enor. He was noted as a great military captain, who drove the forces of Sauron back into the east of Middle-earth. He was also as the first King whose name is recorded with an Ad?aic equivalent, Ar-Belzagar, a sign of the ascendancy of the party of the so-called King's Men. There is some confusion over his successor. The Lord of the Rings lists the King following Tar-Calmacil as Ar-Ad?akh?, but this may be due to an accidental omission, as evidence exists that Tar-Calmacil was in fact succeeded by his son Tar-Ardamin, and that Ar-Ad?akh? was actually his grandson.


* Tar-Ciryatan|Ciryatan
Twelfth King of N?enor 'the Shipbuilder'.
-----
The twelfth King of N?enor, a great shipbuilder and adventurer, who plundered Middle-earth of its treasures and carried them back to N?enor.

Twenty-third King of N?enor, who repented of the ways of the Kings, and took his name in Quenya: 'He who looks afar'; named in Ad?aic (Ar-)Inzilad?.
-----
The last Faithful King of N?enor.
 The twenty-fourth, and last but one, of the Kings of N?enor. In his time, the N?en?eans had turned their backs on the Valar and the Elves, and he attempted to bring them back to the old ways. His policy of reform would likely have been continued by his daughter M?iel, but her throne was usurped by Ar-Pharaz?.


* Tar-S?ion|S?ion|Tar-Surion|Surion
Ninth Ruler of N?enor.
-----
Ninth of the rulers of N?enor.
 Tar-S?ion was the grandson of Tar-Ancalim? N?enor's first Ruling Queen. His father Tar-An?ion had two daughters who were both older than Tar-S?ion, and thus had a claim on the throne. Both of these refused the rule of N?enor, however, and so Tar-S?ion received his father's Kingship.
 We know little of Tar-S?ion's reign, except that he ruled at a time when the Elves of Eregion had begun the forging of the Rings of Power. He had no sons, and when he gave up the Sceptre his daughter Tar-Telperi? became the second Ruling Queen.


* Tar-Telemmait?Telemmait?Tar-Telemmaite|Telemmaite
Fifteenth Ruler of N?enor, so named ('Silver-handed') for his love of silver.
-----
The avaricious fifteenth King of N?enor.
 The fifteenth King of N?enor, the son of Tar-Ancalimon. He was hungry for wealth (hence his name 'King Silverhand') and mined for mithril to fill his treasuries.


* Tar-Telemnar
Quenya name of Ar-Gimilz?.


* Tar-Telperi?|Tar-Telperien
Tenth Ruler of N?enor and the second Ruling Queen.
-----
N?enor's second Ruling Queen.
 The tenth ruler of N?enor was its second Ruling Queen: Tar-Telperi?. She was the eldest child of King Tar-S?ion, and became a proud and wilful Queen. What records we have of her reign state that she refused to wed, and so died without an heir. During her rule in N?enor, momentous events were taking place in Middle-earth; the Rings of Power were forged, and Sauron's armies swept through Eriador. It was left to Tar-Telperi?'s successor, Tar-Minastir, to react to these events.
 Tar-Telperi? ruled N?enor for one hundred and seventy-five years, and was succeeded by her nephew, the son of her younger brother Isilmo, who ruled as Tar-Minastir.


* Tar-Vanimeld?(forest)|Tar-Vanimeld?Tar-Vanimelde
'Forest of the Great Fear', Sindarin name of Mirkwood. See Taur-nu-Fuin.


* Tar-Vanimeld?(Queen of N?enor)|Tar-Vanimeld?Tar-Vanimelde
Third and last of N?enor's Ruling Queens.
 The daughter of Tar-Telemmait?inherited the rule of N?enor from her father to become the island's sixteenth monarch, and third Ruling Queen. She gave little thought to the practicalities of government, though, and preferred music and dancing. The day-to-day affairs of state she left to her husband Herucalmo, who was of noble descent himself, and effectively ruled N?enor while his wife sat on the throne.
 Tar-Vanimeld?was Queen for one hundred and eleven years. When she died, she should have been succeeded by her son, but Herucalmo refused to give up his power. Instead, though he had no legal claim to the throne, he took the name Tar-Anducal and ruled as King for the next twenty years. After Herucalmo's death, the line passed back to its rightful heir, his son, who became King Tar-Alcarin.


* Tarannon Falastur|Tarannon
Twelfth King of Gondor. See Falastur.
-----
The first of Gondor's four Ship-kings.
 The son and heir of King Siriondil of Gondor, who was famed for his naval exploits, and founded the line of the Ship-kings that continued until the time of Hyarmendacil I.

 One of the sons of King Siriondil of Gondor. His elder brother was Tarannon, who took the title Falastur and ruled as King of Gondor after his father. Tarannon's Queen Ber?hiel was sent into exile. Tarannon therefore died childless, and so it was Tarciryan's son who succeeded Tarannon to the throne. This was E?nil I, the second of the Ship-kings after Tarannon himself.

* Tarondor (King of Gondor)|Tarondor
Gondor's longest-reigning King.
 The twenty-seventh King of Gondor, who came to the throne in his youth after his uncle King Telemnar and all his children were lost in the Great Plague. It was Tarondor who moved the King's House from Osgiliath to Minas Anor (later to be named Minas Tirith). He reigned for 162 years, and was succeeded by his son who became the famous warrior King, Telumehtar Umbardacil.


* Tarostar
Given name of R?endacil I.
-----
The birth-name of R?endacil I.
 A Man of Gondor, born into its Royal House in the time his great-grandfather E?endil ruled as King. He lived through the reigns of his grandfather Anardil and his father Ostoher before becoming King of Gondor himself.
 Two years before his succession, Gondor was suddenly beset by Wild Men out of the East, and Tarostar went to war in place of his father, who was in the last days of his old age. Tarostar's war with the Easterlings was a hard one, lasting for ten years, and seeing the death of Ostoher and Tarostar's own succession to Gondor's throne. At last, the Easterlings were driven back, and Tarostar took a new name, R?endacil, 'East-victor', under which to rule the South-kingdom.
 Decades later, the Easterlings renewed their attacks on Gondor. Once again, Tarostar rode out to meet them, but the name of 'East-victor' did him no good - he was slain in the assault and his reign came to an end. It fell to his son Turambar to take up the challenge; he avenged his father by driving back the Easterlings once again and claiming much land east of Anduin for Gondor.
 The events of Tarostar's life were strangely mirrored some seven centuries after his time. Another great Gondorian, Minalcar, took charge of Gondor's armies in place of its King, and like Tarostar he led them to victory in the east. Following Tarostar's example, he too took the name R?endacil, and would one day rule as R?endacil II.

 A series of signs and symbols used when writing with the tengwar, consisting of a variety of dots, curls and other marks written above or below Elvish letters.

 Telperion endured throughout the Years of the Trees, but came to an end in the dreadful event known as the Darkening of Valinor. Even though the elder tree did not survive, he was not the last of the White Trees. Yavanna had made an image of him in Tirion, called Galathilion, from whom the White Trees of N?enor and later of Minas Tirith were descended. More importantly, one of Telperion's flowers survived the Darkening, and was set aloft by the Valar; this was the light we call the Moon.

* Thain of the Shire
Title of the Oldbucks and the Tooks.
 The largely honorary title of the military leader of the Shire. The first Shire-thain was Bucca of the Marish, and the title was held by eleven of his descendants the Oldbucks until their removal across the River Brandywine to Buckland. Thereafter the title was held by the head of the Took clan, from Isumbras I onwards.
 It is known that there were at least thirty-three Shire-thains, from Bucca, who became Thain in III 1979, to Faramir I, who took on the title in IV 63, more than a thousand years later.
-----
1- Bucca of the Marish (Thain from III 1979): The first Thain was given the title in III 1979 (379 by the Shire-reckoning) in a time when the northern lands were recovering from a devastating war in which the old kingdom of Arthedain had come to an end. He was succeeded by Thains of the Oldbuck line.
2-11- Ten Thains of the Oldbuck line (Thains for about 300 years to III 2340): Bucca was followed by Thains whose names are not recorded, but who took the surname 'Oldbuck' in honour of their ancestor.
12- Gorhendad Oldbuck (Thain to III 2340): The line of the Oldbucks came to an end with Gorhendad, who crossed the River Brandywine and founded Buckland, changing his name to Brandybuck. The Thainship passed from him to the Took family, and Gorhendad was succeeded by the first Thain of the Took line.
13- Isumbras I (Thain from III 2340): The thirteenth Thain in line from Bucca, and the first of the Took line. Isumbras' descendants would hold the Thainship for the rest of the recorded history of the Shire.
14-21- Eight Thains of the Took line (Thains for about two hundred years to III 2683): The eight Tooks to hold the Thainship after Isumbras I are nowhere named, but we can infer some of their identities from the names of later holders of the office. Among these eight must have been Isengrim I, Ferumbras I, Paladin I and Isumbras II, but no records of their Thainships are known.
22- Isengrim II (Thain for 39 years to III 2722): The twenty-second Thain, and tenth of the Took line. He began the excavation of Great Smials, which would become the seat of the Thains in the Tookland. He became Thain soon after the first pipe-weed was introduced into the Shire by Tobold Hornblower. He was succeeded by his son.
23- Isumbras III (Thain for 32 years to III 2759): His younger son was Bandobras Took, the famous 'Bullroarer'. In Isumbras' time the Shire was greatly troubled by Orcs, and Bandobras defeated a band of them at the Battle of Greenfields during his Thainship. Bandobras, though, was Isumbras' younger son - the Thainship passed instead to his older brother.
24- Ferumbras II (Thain for 42 years to III 2801): He was succeeded by his son.
25- Fortinbras I (Thain for 47 years to III 2848): At the beginning of his Thainship, the Shire would have seen much activity as Dwarves of Durin's Folk travelled westward to settle in the Blue Mountains. He was succeeded by his son.
26- Gerontius (Thain for 72 years to III 2920): The famous Old Took, who held the office of Thain for a total of seventy-two of his one hundred and thirty years, and had a total of twelve children. During his Thainship, the Shire suffered the dreadful privations of the Fell Winter, and invasions of White Wolves. He was succeeded by the eldest of his many sons.
27- Isengrim III (Thain for 10 years to III 2930): Due to the Old Took's many years in office, his eldest son Isengrim was no less than eighty-eight years old when he inherited the Thainship. He held it for just ten years and died without leaving an heir. He was succeeded by his younger brother.
28- Isumbras IV (Thain for 9 years to III 2939): Like his brother Isengrim, Isumbras came old to the Thainship, being ninety-two when he took office. After his short time as the Shire-thain, he was succeeded by his son.
29- Fortinbras II (Thain for 41 years to III 2980): Early in his time as Thain there was a sensation in Hobbiton, due to the mysterious disappearance into the Wild - and later reappearance - of one Bilbo Baggins of Bag End. Fortinbras was succeeded by his son.
30- Ferumbras III (Thain for 35 years to III 3015): He was Thain at the time of Bilbo Baggins' famous farewell feast and Birthday Party, which indeed he attended. He never married, and so left no heir. The descent of the Thainship passed to the line of Gerontius' fourth son Hildigrim, and specifically to Hildigrim's grandson.
31- Paladin II (Thain for 19 years to IV 13): Born in the time that his great uncle Isumbras IV was Thain, Paladin took up a farming life at Whitwell in the Tookland. He was Thain during the War of the Ring, and held the Tookland against the ruffians who invaded the Shire at that time. He was succeeded by his fourth child, but eldest son.
32- Peregrin I (Thain for 50 years to IV 63): Peregrin Took of the Fellowship of the Ring inherited the Thainship some thirteen years after his return from adventuring in the south, and held the title into his old age. At the age of ninety-four, he gave up the office and rode away once again into the countries of the south with his friend Meriadoc Brandybuck; they were never seen in the Shire again. He was succeeded by his son.
33- Faramir I (Thain from IV 63): Named for Faramir the Prince of Ithilien, little is known of Thain Faramir, except that he married Sam Gamgee'sdaughter Goldilocks. Doubtless he was succeeded by further generations of Shire-thains, but of them we have no record.

Perhaps the best known, and indeed the only one mentioned by name in The Lord of the Rings, is Forlong the Fat, the Lord of Lossarnach who met his fate in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. In his Letters, though, Tolkien introduces us to a character who shares Forlong's title - Lalia the Fat, the widow of Thain Fortinbras Took II of the Shire.

 Apparently the youngest of the three was Grimbeorn, who is reported to have ruled in the Vales of Anduin in the year III 3018. The evidence points strongly to his being born after Bilbo's visit to his father in III 2941, so his age could be no more than 77 at the time he is called 'The Old'. He may, of course, have lived longer that this.
 B?r was the first of Men to encounter the Elves, having led his people across the Blue Mountains into Beleriand. He was 49 at the time of that meeting, and died after another forty-four years of service to Finrod Felagund, at the age of 93.
 The oldest of the three, though, was Aldor, the third King of Rohan. He lived for more than a century, 101 years to be precise, and ruled the land of the Rohirrim for no less than seventy-five years.

* The Rider
Pursuer of the earliest Elves.
 A shadowy creature of Elvish legend, sent by Melkor to trouble the first Elves at Cuivi?en.


* The Ring
Sauron's One Ring to bind all Rings.
 The powerful artefact of Sauron more properly called the One Ring or the Ruling Ring.
 The Ring was born out of a plan Sauron devised to enslave the peoples of Middle-earth. He took on the form of a wise adviser, under the name Annatar, and offered great knowledge to the Elves. Many rejected him, but Celebrimbor and the Elves of Eregion accepted his offer, and he schooled them in the making of Rings of Power. At last, Annatar and the Elves made sixteen jewelled Rings that would in time become the Seven Rings of the Dwarves and the Nine Rings of Men.
 Now Sauron put his scheme into motion. Returning to his land of Mordor, to the forges of Sammath Naur in the heart of Mount Doom, he began the secret making of another Ring. He filled it with his own power and malice, to wield power over all the other Rings of Power, and bind their wearers to his will.
 His plan failed. The Elves, too, had made themselves Rings, so powerful that when Sauron took up his Ruling Ring, they perceived that they were betrayed. Taking off their own Rings, they escaped the trap that Sauron had set for them. In anger, Sauron swept out of Mordor with his armies; Eregion was destroyed, Celebrimbor was slain, and Sauron recovered fifteen of the Rings of Power (the Three Rings of the Elves had been sent into secret hiding, and one of the original sixteen had already been given by Celebrimbor to Durin III of Khazad-d?).
 Under the binding power of the Ring, Sauron subverted nine Men, whose Rings of Power twisted them slowly into wraiths, the Nazg?, whose only will was Sauron's. He attempted the same with Dwarves, but they proved resistant to the Rings' powers, and those of their Rings that were not destroyed the Dark Lord reclaimed. The power of Sauron's Ruling Ring was such, though, that it wielded power of the wills of lesser beings whether or not they wore another Ring. In Tolkien's Letters, we're told that he used it to bring about nothing less than the destruction of N?enor, by twisting the will of its King, Ar-Pharaz?, and his followers.
 What Sauron could not have foreseen was that the Downfall of N?enor would ultimately bring about his own destruction, and the loss of his Ring. Nine ships escaped the Downfall and landed in Middle-earth, carrying Elendil and his sons Isildur and An?ion. Together, they founded great realms in Middle-earth, and allied themselves with Gil-galad and the Elves against Sauron. So began the long War of the Last Alliance, in which Sauron was at last defeated, and his Ring taken by Isildur. But Isildur did not hold the Ring for long. He was set upon by Orcs on the banks of the Great River, and the Ring was lost in its depths, where it would lie for two and a half millennia.
 It was found at last by D?gol, a creature of hobbit-kind, and then passed through a strange series of events. No sooner had D?gol recovered it than he was killed by his companion Sm?gol, who stole the Ring for himself. Driven out by his family, who gave him the name Gollum, he wandered into the depths beneath the Misty Mountains, and there he lurked for more than five centuries, his life stretched by the power of the Ring. By a twist of fate, he lost it, and it came into the hands of Bilbo Baggins, lost and wandering in the depths where Gollum dwelt.
 Bilbo carried it through adventure and battle, eventually bringing it back to the Shire. It passed to his heir Frodo, and at last its identity was discovered by the Wizard Gandalf. Over the centuries, Sauron had recovered much of his strength, and he too learned that the Ring had been found, and discovered that it was held in the Shire. So began the War of the Ring, a desperate race to destroy Sauron's Ring in the fires of its birth, before its Lord could reclaim it and use its power to enslave the World.

(Quenta Silmarillion 19, Of Beren and L?hien)
-----
One of the many names for the seven-starred constellation that turned, and still turns, through the northern skies every night of the year. To the Elves this was the Valacirca, the Sickle of the Valar that signalled the downfall of Morgoth, but the Men of the Northern lands called it simply 'The Wain'. The Seven Stars are today known as the Plough, or the Big Dipper.


* The Sheen
A poetic name for the Moon.
 A title given to the Moon by the Vanyar, the Light Elves of Valinor, at the time of its creation. The name is a translation of Elvish Isil.

* The Shire|Shire
The chief dwelling-place of Hobbits in the west of Eriador.
-----
The land of Hobbits west of the Brandywine.
 At the end of the Third Age, the Shire was the most populous country of the Hobbits in the north of Middle-earth. It was founded in the middle of the Third Age by the Bree-hobbits Marcho and Blanco, and gifted to them and their followers by King Argeleb II of Arthedain, within whose borders the land lay at that time.
 The Shire was divided into four farthings, North, South, East and West; its chief town was at Michel Delving on the White Downs, in the Westfarthing. The Mayor of Michel Delving was accounted among the most important of the Shire-hobbits, as was the Thain (the head of the Took family).
 The Shire was largely given over to agriculture, and its land was well-suited for farming. One of its chief products was Halflings' Leaf (tobacco), grown especially in the warmer regions of the Southfarthing.

* The Wain|Wain
A Mannish name for the Sickle of the Valar.
 The name in the northern lands of Middle-earth for the constellation we know today as the Plough or the Big Dipper. In Tolkien's mythology, these seven stars were set in the sky by Varda in the shape of a mighty sickle, as a warning to Melkor and his underlings. The Men and Hobbits of the northern lands seem to have been ignorant of this, though: they gave these stars the more prosaic name of 'the Wain', meaning a wagon or cart.
 Other Names: The Sickle of the Valar, Valacirca.


* The Water
The main river of the Shire.
 A tributary of the River Brandywine that rose in the Westfarthing of the Shire, and flowed eastward to meet the Brandywine just north of the Brandywine Bridge. Hobbiton and Bywater both stood on this river.

The meaning of T?in's alias Neithan.
 After the accidental death of Saeros at his hands, T?in fled the land of Doriath where he had been brought up, and lived for a time among a band of outlaws beyond its western borders. It was Saeros' taunts of T?in that had led to his death, and therefore T?in took a new name among the outlaws, Neithan, meaning 'The Wronged'.


* The Young
The title of Eorl.
 A title most famously given to Eorl son of L?d, who inherited the lordship of the ?th?d while still in his teens, after his father's early death. This title is also given to Hathaldir, one of the outlaws of Dorthonion led by Barahir.

* Thingol

* Third Age
Last of the Elder Days.
 The Third Age began a little over four thousand years after the Rising of the Moon in the first year of the First Age. Of the Ages, it is the best known, as the events of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings took place in its later years.
 The Third Age began with the first overthrow of Sauron by the Last Alliance, and was marked by Isildur's planting of the White Tree in Minas Anor. It ended more than three thousand years later with the destruction of the One Ring, the final end of Sauron, and the passing of the Ring-bearers over the Sea.
 The history of the Third Age is in large part the history of the D?edain in Gondor and Arnor. Though both these realms were founded in the late Second Age, it was during the Third that they grew to their greatest heights, and fell to their lowest depths, before being reunited by Aragorn II Elessar.

* Three-Farthing Stone
The meeting point of three of the Shire's farthings.
 A stone by the side of the East Road that marked the point where the borders of the Eastfarthing, Westfarthing and Southfarthing of the Shire came together. It was also said to mark a point near the centre of the Shire itself. The stone stood about five miles southeast from Bywater, and exactly fourteen miles west from Frogmorton.
 The fourth farthing, the Northfarthing, did not meet the others at the Three-Farthing Stone. Instead, its borders met those of the Westfarthing and Eastfarthing about ten miles north of the Stone, though there is no record of a second three-farthing stone to mark this spot.

* Thr?'s Map|Thror's Map
The map that guided the Quest of Erebor.
 A map made by Thr? the King under the Mountain, after he had been exiled from his kingdom by the Dragon Smaug. As was traditional among the Dwarves, it was drawn with East at the top of the map, rather than North, and showed the Lonely Mountain of Erebor, the Running River that flowed from it, and the lands about. It also contained mention of a secret entrance to the Mountain, and (written in secret Moon-letters) instructions as to how it might be opened.
 In his old age, Thr? set out to wander the lands of Middle-earth, but before departing he gave the heirlooms of his house to his son Thr?n, including his Map. Years later, Thr?n too set out into Middle-earth, seeking to recover Erebor himself, and taking with him the Map to guide his way. He was captured in the Wild by the servants of Sauron, but Sauron captured Thr?n for the Ring of Power he bore, and so overlooked the Map he carried too. This proved to be a serious oversight, because Gandalf secretly entered Sauron's lair at Dol Guldur while Thr?n was a prisoner there, and managed to escape with the Map and the key that opened the secret door.
 Using Thr?'s Map, his grandson Thorin was able to lead a small group of Dwarves (and one Hobbit, a certain Bilbo Baggins) on his own quest to refound the ancient Dwarf-realm. Through many adventures, they were able to recover Erebor and bring about the destruction of Smaug, dealing Sauron a serious reverse.

* Tighfield
The home of Sam Gamgee's ancestors.
 A village or town located somewhere in the Shire, though its exact location is not known. It is important to history as the home of many of Sam Gamgee's ancestors. His great-great-grandfather Wiseman Gamwich came to Tighfield about two hundred years before the War of the Ring, and Wiseman's son Hob Gammidge is recorded as a roper, one of a long line of Tighfield rope-makers. Hob's grandson was Hamfast Gamgee, Sam's father, who left Tighfield for Hobbiton, to start a new life as a gardener.
 Tighfield's name probably descends from an old word for a common field or pasture, and this fits well with the fact that there seem to have been fairs held there. Indeed, Hob's son Hobson, and in turn his son Andwise, were said to have often shown off their skills in a rope-walk there. The Shire-hobbits loved punning place-names, though, and the fact that Tighfield was associated with ropes and roping is perhaps more than coincidence.


* Tilion
A Maia, steersman of the Moon.
-----
The steersman of the Moon.
 Originally a hunter of Orom?s people, famed for his silver bow. After the Darkening of Valinor, Tilion was chosen by the Valar to become the pilot of the Moon. Now he steers the last flower of Telperion across the sky, though sometimes by uncertain paths.

Her only mention in records is a single appearance in a genealogical chart showing the early descendants of her father, where she is shown beside her brothers Vardamir, Manwendil and Atanalcar.


* Tindrock
The steep-sided isle of Nen Hithoel.
 The Mannish name for the steep, rocky island that stood at the southern end of Nen Hithoel, above the Falls of Rauros. The Elves called the island Tol Brandir ('tall island') but the name Tindrock has slightly different origins. In Old English a tind is a sharp point, so the Tindrock was the 'pointed rock'.
 The tall point of the Tindrock stood up between two hills, one on either of the shores of Nen Hithoel: Amon Hen to the west and Amon Lhaw to the east. In the great days of Gondor, these hills were important watch-posts at its northern borders. The island of the Tindrock, though, had never been visited by Men, or so the legends said.

* Tobold 'Old Toby' Hornblower|Tobold Hornblower
The first Shire-hobbit to grow pipe-weed.
 A famous Hobbit of Longbottom in the South-farthing of the Shire. In his younger days, Tobold was something of a traveller, and made the eastward journey to Bree on several occasions. It was there, it is generally supposed, that he came across the cultivation and smoking of pipe-weed. Tobold must have collected some of these plants and brought them back to his own garden in Longbottom. (At least, this is the most likely version of events - Tobold himself remained silent on the matter).
 The Southfarthing seems to have been ideal for the growing of pipe-weed, and it became one the Shire's most important industries. Among the different varieties that were developed, one was named 'Old Toby' in honour of Tobold its first grower.


* Tol Brandir
The island known as the Tindrock.
 The tall, sheer-sided isle that stood in the River Anduin between the hills of Amon Hen and Amon Lhaw, above the Falls of Rauros.

 When the waves consumed Beleriand and the regions around it after the War of Wrath, not all of the western lands were lost. The highlands that had been Dorthonion, and came to be called Taur-nu-Fuin, in part survived the inrush of the sea, and remained as an island far off the western coasts of Forlindon.


* Tol Galen

-----

There, burrowed into the hillsides, was the famous and historic home of the Tooks, Great Smials. Somewhat to the west of Tuckborough lay the smaller of the Tookland's main settlements, Tookbank.


* Torog
The Elves' name for those of troll-kind.
 The Sindarin word that Tolkien normally renders as 'troll' in his works. The derivation of this word is uncertain - it may be derived from older Elvish words or perhaps imitates olog, which seems to be the comparative term in the Black Speech.

An ancient stronghold of Arnor.
 A tower built by Elendil in the founding years of Arnor, to hold one of the North-kingdom's three palant?i. It stood on the hill known as Amon S? or Weathertop, which at that time lay in the central parts of Elendil's northern domains. The later breakup of Arnor, though, left the Tower in exposed borderlands, and it was eventually destroyed by the invading armies of Angmar.

 The great tower of the haven of Avall??on Tol Eress?; said to be the first sight a mariner sees when approaching the Undying Lands.

 Originally a watchtower of Gondor guarding the main pass over the Ephel D?th, the Tower was captured by the forces of Sauron and held by Orcs in the later Third Age.


* Tower of Ecthelion
The White Tower at the peak of Minas Tirith.
-----
"... the Tower of Ecthelion, standing high within the topmost walls, shone out against the sky, glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver, tall and fair and shapely, and its pinnacle glittered as if it were wrought of crystals..."
(The Return of the King V 1, Minas Tirith)
-----
Though a White Tower had graced the highest point of Minas Tirith since ancient times, it was rebuilt by Steward Ecthelion I some three centuries before the War of the Ring, and so gained his name. The Tower of Ecthelion was used to bear the standard of the City, and - at least during the last years of the Third Age - held the palant? known as the Anor-stone.

Minas Ithil beneath the Ephel D?th.
 A poetic name given to Minas Ithil, emphasising its position on the far eastern borders of the realm of Gondor.


* Tower of the Setting Sun|Tower of the Sun
A name for Minas Anor.
 The great tower built beneath Mount Mindolluin, west of the River Anduin, in the earliest days of Gondor. Its position west of the River, compared with Isildur's tower of Minas Ithil in the east, is the reason for its association with the 'Setting' Sun.
 Historically, It was the tower of An?ion the son of Elendil, and over the centuries it came to replace Osgiliath as the seat of the Kings of Gondor. A thousand years before the War of the Ring, Minas Ithil was captured by the Nazg?, and the Tower of the Setting Sun became the Tower of Guard, Minas Tirith. With its new name, the city remained a barrier to the forces of Mordor throughout the next millennium.


* Towers of the Teeth
The watchtowers east and west of the Morannon.
-----
The twin guardians of Mordor.
 At the northwest corner of Mordor, the Ephel D?th and the Ered Lithui came together at the Haunted Pass of Cirith Gorgor, and formed a gateway into that dark land. In the early days of Gondor, after Sauron's first defeat, the Gondorians built two watchtowers at the entrance to the pass, to guard Mordor and prevent the return of Sauron's servants. They failed, and the watchtowers fell under the control of the Red Eye. They became known as Carchost and Narchost, the Towers of the Teeth.

-----
The messenger of Ulmo.
 The son of Huor and cousin to T?in Turambar, Tuor is renowned as the father of E?endil the Mariner. In his youth, Tuor journeyed into Nevrast, and there spoke with the Vala Ulmo. Ulmo sent him as messenger to Turgon in Gondolin. Dwelling there, he wedded Turgon's daughter Idril, who gave birth to E?endil. After the Fall of Gondolin, he dwelt with the Exiles at the Mouths of Sirion for a time, but feeling old age coming upon him, he built the great ship E?r??and sailed into the West with Idril.

-----
The surname of T?in.
 A title meaning 'Master of Doom', taken by T?in son of H?in in defiance of the curse placed upon his family by Morgoth.


* Turambar (King of Gondor)
The ninth King of the South-kingdom.
 The heir of King R?endacil I, who succeeded to the throne of Gondor after the violent death of his father at the hands of the Easterlings. Turambar sought vengeance for his father's death, and succeeded brilliantly. We are told that he not only avenged the loss of R?endacil, but carried his conquests into the lands of the Easterlings themselves, winning much new territory for his Kingdom.
 Due to his father's untimely loss, Turambar came early to Gondor's throne. His rule lasted longer than a century, and was the longer by far than that of any preceding Gondorian monarch since that of his ancestor Meneldil.
 Turambar ruled Gondor for one hundred and twenty-six years, and was succeeded by his son, who became Atanatar I.


* Turgon
The second son of Fingolfin; dwelt at Vinyamar in Nevrast before he departed in secret to Gondolin, which he ruled until his death in the sack of the city; father of Idril the mother of E?endil. Called the Wise, and the Hidden King.

* T?in I (Steward of Gondor)|T?in I|T?in|Turin
The sixth Ruling Steward of Gondor, who succeeded his father H?in I to the Stewardship. Like his father, T?in was named for a great hero of the First Age, and this seems to have become a trend in the House of the Stewards after his time. For five generations after T?in, starting with his son Hador, his descendants were named for Elves or Men of the First Age.
 T?in ruled Gondor during the time known as the Watchful Peace, during which Sauron had withdrawn into the east and did not trouble the western lands of Middle-earth. Hence, his time as Steward was rather uneventful in historical terms.
 T?in ruled as Steward for thirty-four years, and was succeeded by his son Hador.


* T?in II (Steward of Gondor)|T?in II|T?in|Turin
The twenty-third Ruling Steward of Gondor, the son of Thorondir, and great-grandfather of Denethor II. He is most famous for his defeat of an army of the Haradrim at the Crossings of Poros, with the aid of King Folcwine of Rohan.


* T?in Turambar|T?in|Turin
Son of H?in and Morwen; chief subject of the lay named Narn i H? H?in from which Chapter XXI of 'The Silmarillion' was derived. For his other names see Neithan, Gorthol, Agarwaen, Mormegil, Wildman of the Woods, Turambar, Thurin.
-----
Doomed son of H?in Thalion.
 The most tragic of Tolkien's heroes, T?in, son of H?in Thalion and cousin to Tuor, was in his time the most feared of Men by the servants of Morgoth. He did great service to both Doriath and Nargothrond, and is famed for slaying Glaurung, Father of Dragons, but the curse of Morgoth was on him, and evil followed him always. In the Forest of Brethil he came upon his own sister, but through the spells of Glaurung they did not know each other, and wed. After Nienor discovered the truth, she threw herself to her death, and in despair T?in fell upon his own sword.


* Turnips|Turnip

* Two Captains
T?in Turambar and Beleg Strongbow.
 The two great warriors of the First Age who together led the outlaws of Dor-C?rthol, the Land of Bow and Helm. They were a menace to Morgoth's forces for a time, until he assaulted and overwhelmed their chief stronghold at Bar-en-Danwedh.


* Two Kindreds
Elves and Men.


* Two Kingdoms
The Kingdoms of the D?edain.
 Arnor and Gondor, the twin Kingdoms founded before the beginning of the Third Age by Elendil and his sons Isildur and An?ion. The Kingdoms, and especially the South-kingdom of Gondor, came to dominate the history of that Age.


* Two Trees of the Valar
Telperion and Laurelin.
 An occasional term for the Two Trees of Valinor, made for the Valar by Yavanna and Nienna.


* Two Trees of Valinor
The Trees of Silver and Gold.
 Telperion and Laurelin, the Silver Tree and the Gold that brought light to the Land of the Valar in ancient times. The were destroyed by Melkor and Ungoliant, but their last flower and fruit were made by the Valar into the Moon and the Sun.


* Tyeller|Tyell?Tyelle
The six grades of the Tengwar.
 The six 'grades' used to indicate modifications to a basic sound in Tengwar. For example, where the first tyell?referred to the basic 't' sound - the tengwa known as tinco - the other five tyeller would represent modifications of this basic sound. In this case - the sequence known as the tincot?a - the next three tyeller would typically represent the sounds 'd', 'th', 'dh', while the meanings of the last two would vary according to the particular system in use.


* Tyelp?ema|Tyelpetema
The 'Silver-series'.
 One of the five t?ar or sound-series of the tengwar as used to represent the sounds of the Quenya language.
 The tyelpet?a appears to have been unique; while each of the other four series consisted of a set of six individual 'letters', the palatal sounds of the tyelpet?a were formed by adding a mark of two dots beneath another character, as in the example above3. This is the equivalent of adding a 'y' after the letter in English to form a single distinct consonant sound. To use Tolkien's own example from Appendix E to The Lord of the Rings, the sound 'ty' here has the same sound as the initial consonant in the (British pronunciation of) the English word 'tune' - something close to, but distinct from, 'ch'.


* Tyrn Gorthad
Sindarin name of the Barrow-downs.
-----
The Barrow-downs.
 The downlands east of the Old Forest, a region that had been used as the burial grounds of Men from time immemorial. The first graves were cut there, it is said, before the ancestors of the Edain set out across the Blue Mountains into Beleriand, nearly seven thousand years before the War of the Ring.
 The tradition of the Barrow-downs was carried on by the descendants of these early Men, and there is evidence that the burial chambers were used for at least the princes of Cardolan, in whose realm they came to lie many millennia after their first use.
 At the height of the kingdom of Angmar, its lord the Witch-king sent out evil spirits to dwell among the barrows of Tyrn Gorthad, and it became a haunted place, shunned alike by the Men and Hobbits who lived nearby.


* Ud? (fortress)|Ud?|Udun
Melkor's ancient fortress in the far north of the World.
-----
"The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Ud?. Go back to the Shadow!"
(Words of Gandalf, from The Fellowship of the Ring II 5, The Bridge of Khazad-d?)
-----
The Sindarin name of Utumno, the fortress of Melkor in the far north of the World. It was the first and greatest of Melkor's citadels, delved in the earliest days, the home to hosts of demons and monsters. From Ud?, Melkor troubled the world for millennia. From there, he destroyed the Lamps of the Valar, so that Powers left Almaren, their dwelling-place in Middle-earth, and removed into the West. At the time of the awakening of the Elves, though, the Valar attacked Ud? in full force, and destroyed it utterly, carrying its master back to Valinor as their prisoner.
 The name Ud? is much less common as a name for Melkor's fortress than the equivalent Utumno. In The Lord of the Rings it appears just once, in Gandalf's quote given above. It survived, though, as a name for the northern valley of Mordor that lay behind the Morannon. No doubt Sauron chose this name in memory of his ancient master's greatest stronghold.


* Ud? (valley)|Ud?|Udun
The valley behind the Gates of Mordor.
 The deep valley in the northwest of Mordor, formed at the meeting of the Ered Lithui and the Ephel D?th, whose northern entrance was guarded by the Morannon.

* Ulmo|Dweler in the Deep|Dweller of the Deep
A Vala, one of the Aratar, called Lord of Waters and King of the Sea, The name was interpreted by the Eldar to mean 'The Pourer' or 'The Rainer'.
-----
The Lord of Waters.
 Lord of the Seas and one of the greatest of the Valar; in the dark days of the First Age, he kept watch on Elves and Men while the others of his order remained in Valinor. He is famed for bringing Tuor to Gondolin, and so ultimately bringing about the downfall of Morgoth in the War of Wrath.


* Ulrad
A member of the outlaw-band (Gaurwaith) that T?in joined.
-----
An outlaw of the Gaurwaith.
 A member of the outlaw band that T?in joined, and ultimately led, after his self-imposed exile from Doriath. Ulrad travelled with the other outlaws to Bar-en-Danwedh. His fate is not known for certain, but he was likely lost in that stronghold when it was overcome by Orcs.

-----
The great haven far to the south of Gondor.
 A cape in the far south of Middle-earth, long held by Black N?en?eans, but conquered by Gondor for a time during the Third Age.


* Umbardacil
The title taken by King Telumehtar.
 In the early years of Telumehtar's reign over Gondor, his country's coasts were still prey to assaults from the Corsairs of Umbar, under the command of the descendants of Castamir. Telumehtar resolved to put an end to these attacks, and in III 1810 marshalled an assault of his own. In a great victory, the Corsairs were driven out of Umbar, which was captured for Gondor, and Telumehtar added the title Umbardacil, 'Victor over Umbar', to his name. Umbar was held by Gondor throughout Telumehtar's reign, but was lost soon after his death.

'Evenstar'.
 Title and surname of Arwen, Queen to Aragorn II Elessar. It usually given in its translated form, Evenstar.


* Undying Lands|Deathless Lands
Aman and Eress?; also called the Deathless Lands.
-----
The lands beyond the Great Sea.
 A name of Aman, or at least that part of it inhabited by the Valar, Maiar and Elves. The island of Tol Eress? is several times identified as the easternmost of the Undying Lands, and, at the least, Valinor must also be included.
 'Undying Lands' seems to be a name that originated among Men. The N?en?eans, especially, envied the seemingly endless life of those who lived in the Undying Lands. From the first, the Valar placed a Ban on the Men of N?enor, that they should not sail into the West from their island, or set foot on the shores of Aman.
 Wise as the Valar were, though, they did not foresee the wiles of Sauron. This great Maia falsely persuaded the last King of N?enor, Ar-Pharaz?, that the ruler of the Undying Lands would be undying himself. Believing Sauron, Ar-Pharaz? assembled a great navy and sailed westward to make hopeless war on the Valar for the imagined prize of endless life.
 The Valar could not permit this: Manw?called upon Il?atar, and the land of N?enor was destroyed and lost forever. The Undying Lands, which until that time had been part of the world, were removed forever from the reach of Mortal Men, though the Elves could still sail West and come there, if they would.
 It is to the Undying Lands that the white ships sails at the end of The Lord of the Rings. The Ring-bearers, Bilbo and Frodo, were the first mortal beings to set foot on the shores of the Undying Lands. Tolkien is careful to point out, though, that even in Aman, mortals remain mortal.


* Undying Realm
The lands of the Uttermost West.
 The lands of Aman in the West of the World where the High Elves lived, and especially Valinor, the golden land of the immortal Valar.

-----
Ancient ally of Melkor.
 The evil creature of spider-form who was Melkor's accomplice in the Darkening of Valinor, and who fled with him to Middle-earth. The creatures that infested the Ered Gorgoroth were her offspring and descendants, as was Shelob who dwelt on the borders of Mordor.
 The name means 'Gloomweaver'.


* Union of Maedhros

* Urul?i|Uruloki|Urul??Uruloke
Quenya word meaning 'fire-serpent', dragon.
-----
The Fire-drakes.
 The fire-drakes; dragons who breathed fire. Glaurung, Father of Dragons, was the first of these. He first appeared in the middle of the First Age, but the urul?i certainly survived the downfall of their master, Morgoth.
 Ancalagon apparently belonged to this kind1, and Smaug, the great fire-breathing dragon that sacked Erebor, seems to have been the last of the great urul?i. Other lesser types apparently survived to the end of the Third Age and beyond.


* Urwen
The given name of Lalaith, daughter of H?in and Morwen who died in childhood.

* Valacar
Twentieth King of Gondor, whose marriage to Vidumavi of the Northmen led to the civil war of the Kin-strife.
-----
The King who sowed the seeds of the Kin-strife.
 Valacar was the son and heir of the great King of Gondor, R?endacil II. While R?endacil still sat on Gondor's throne, he developed a strong alliance with the Northmen who lived to the east of Mirkwood. To further the close friendship between Gondor and these Northmen, R?endacil sent Valacar as an ambassador to the court of their leader Vidugavia, who styled himself King of Rhovanion.
 R?endacil had intended that his son should learn something of the language and culture of the Men of Rhovanion, but he had not foreseen how strongly Valacar would be drawn to the Northmen. He went so far as to wed Vidumavi, daughter of Vidugavia, a union that would bring great troubles in the future.
 The Northmen did not share the long lives of the Gondorians, and Vidumavi died even before Valacar had succeeded his father as King. Nonetheless, she bore Valacar an heir. He was raised with the name Vinitharya in the eastern lands, but returned to Gondor with his father as Eldacar. These events caused unrest throughout Valacar's reign - it was believed that the pure N?en?ean blood of the Royal House would be lost.
 By the last years of Valacar's reign, certain southern provinces of Gondor saw this unrest break out into full rebellion. In the year Valacar died, III 1432, this rebellion became a civil war, a dark and bloody period known as the Kin-strife that would last for the next fifteen years, until Eldacar managed to secure his throne.
 Valacar ruled as King of Gondor for sixty-six years, and was succeeded through great troubles by his son Eldacar.

-----
The Powers of the World.
 'Valar' is the name given to the fourteen powerful spirits who took physical form and entered Arda after its creation to give order to the world and combat the evils of Melkor. They dwelt originally on the Isle of Almaren, but after its destruction long ages before the Awakening of the Elves they removed to Aman and there founded the realm of Valinor.
-----
Lords of the Valar: Manw?S?imo, Ulmo, Aul?the Smith, Orom? Mandos (N?o), L?ien (Irmo), Tulkas Astaldo. Queens of the Valar (Valier): Varda Elent?i, Yavanna Kement?i, Nienna, Est?the Gentle, Vair?the Weaver, V?a the Ever-young, Nessa.
-----
These are the names of the Valar as they were known to the Eldar in Valinor. In Middle-earth, they were known by other names of Sindarin origin; for example 'Elbereth' for Varda, or 'Araw' for Orom? Their names among Men are said to be legion.
-----
The Valar in the Beginning of Arda: The Valar where in origin the greatest of the Ainur who witnessed the Vision of Il?atar and so descended into E?to fulfil the vision and create Arda. It seems that, in the first beginnings of the World, the four mightiest spirits came down into it; Manw? Ulmo and Aul?to prepare it for the coming of the Children of Il?atar, and Melkor to claim it for his own domain.
 There was conflict between Manw?and Melkor, and Manw?called many other spirits into the World to aid him in his struggle. Among these were the other Valar, and those of lesser order known as Maiar. Melkor then withdrew for a time from Arda to some other hidden place in the deeps of E?
 In time, Manw?and his followers began to achieve their purpose, and make the World ready for the coming of the Children. Seeing this, Melkor grew jealous, and returned to do battle over the fate of Arda. The Earth then saw great upheaval as the rival powers struggled over its destiny (it is thought that the Misty Mountains were raised at this time). Slowly, though, and with great hardship, the Valar succeeded in shaping the World, although everything they created was in some way marred by Melkor.
-----
The Nature of the Valar: Like the Elves, those Valar who chose to enter the World at its beginning are bound to it until it reaches its destined end; they may not return to the Timeless Halls of Il?atar.
 As spirits, the Valar have no fixed physical form, although they often took the shapes of the Children of Il?atar. They could, though, assume any form they chose, or cast aside their shape altogether and travel formless and invisible through Arda.

* Voronda

 An Elvish adjective meaning 'faithul' or 'steadfast', given as a title or surname to the great hero Elendil.


* Vorondil
The first hereditary Steward of Gondor.
 One of three Stewards to serve King E?nil II of Gondor. He was an important figure in Gondorian history, as the first of the Stewards to inherit the title by direct line from his father. Vorondil was the son of Pelendur, the Steward who had assumed the rule of Gondor during the crisis following Ondoher's loss. On Pelendur's own death, his position as servant and adviser to the King fell on Vorondil his son.
 Vorondil's Stewardship was a time of war and loss for Gondor. In only his second year as Steward, he saw the Nazg? come out of Mordor and lay siege to Minas Ithil, and two years later still, they succeeded in capturing it and the palant? it contained.
 History remembers Vorondil less for any part in the loss of Minas Ithil, though, and more as Vorondil the mighty Hunter, who hunted the Kine of Araw in the far eastern lands on the shores of the Sea of Rh?. The great horn carried by Boromir in The Lord of the Rings originated as the hunting horn of Vorondil, and may even have been made by his own hand.
 Vorondil served E?nil as Steward for twenty-one years. Just as he had inherited the position, he was in turn succeeded by his son Mardil, who was to become the first of the Ruling Stewards and the founder of a tradition that would survive in Gondor for nearly two thousand years.

* Wainriders|Wainrider
An Easterling people who invaded Gondor in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries of the Third Age.
-----
Easterling enemies of Gondor.
 A confederation of Easterlings that descended upon Gondor and its allies, some two centuries after the time of the Great Plague, and remained a dire threat to the South-kingdom for nearly a hundred years. The Wainriders, who took their name from the wagons and chariots in which they rode to war, quickly overran Rhovanion and soon came to battle with Gondor itself. Narmacil II was lost in battle, and for a time all of Gondor's possessions east of Anduin were lost to it. Narmacil's son Calimehtar won a temporary reprieve when he defeated the Wainriders on the plain of Dagorlad.
 After that defeat, the Wainriders planned a crushing revenge. Allying themselves with the Men of Harad and Khand, they orchestrated a simultaneous assault on Gondor from the north and the south, and the South-kingdom came close to destruction. King Ondoher was lost in the northern battles, but his general E?nil defeated the southern invaders. The victorious Wainrider army in the north, celebrating their victory over Ondoher, suddenly found themselves set upon by E?nil. In an encounter that became known as the Battle of the Camp, the Wainriders were put to rout, and those that survived fled back to their eastern domains.
 It was later seen that the invasions of the Wainriders, as so many of Gondor's perils, were engineered by the emissaries of Sauron. While Gondor's control of the lands east of the Anduin had been lost, the borders of Mordor had been open, and during this time the Nazg? had taken advantage of Gondor's plight to re-enter the land of their master.


* Walda

* Wandlimb
The long-lost beloved of Treebeard.
 A translation of the Elvish Fimbrethil, both names used by Treebeard for his lost Entwife. They were separated when the Entwives travelled east of the Great River to plant their gardens.

* War of the Ring
The decisive conflict at the end of the Third Age.
 The great conflict at the end of the Third Age, named for the One Ring and the importance this had in the final outcome. The war was fought between the Free (a loose alliance of Elves and Men led by the Wise) and Sauron the Dark Lord, with Saruman as a third power based in Orthanc.
 Sauron at all times held the military advantage in the War, due to his overwhelming forces; not only Orcs and Trolls, but Men of Harad and the East. His main immediate object was the overthrow of Gondor, his near neighbour and the strongest of his enemies. He had such forces at his command, though, that he was able to fight the war on many fronts, also attacking Dale, Erebor and the Wood-elves in the far north, and L?ien from his secondary stronghold at Dol Guldur. There can be no doubt that, had the Wise not achieved possession of the Ring, Sauron would ultimately have been victorious.
 Saruman had claimed alliance with both the Wise and the Dark Lord, but was ultimately fighting for his own ends. In alliance with the Dunlendings, and having Orcs at his own command, his objective was the defeat of Rohan. Until late in the War, he held the advantage, defeating Rohan twice at the Battles of the Fords of Isen. He had not considered the Ents of Fangorn in his plans, however, and when they were roused to anger at his actions, they brought about his downfall.
 The policy of the Wise was based around the Quest of Mount Doom; a company of nine under the leadership of Gandalf travelled from Rivendell with the One Ring, with the hope of reaching Orodruin in Mordor and there destroying it. Because the Ring held much of Sauron's native power, they realised that in unmaking it, they would also defeat its creator. Against all hope, the Quest was achieved by Frodo Baggins, and Sauron defeated.
 The War did not end with the defeat of Sauron, for Saruman fled northward after the capture of Orthanc, and established himself in the Shire, bending the Hobbits to his will by threat of violence and the persuasive power of his voice. The return of Frodo Baggins and his companions led to a rebellion by the Shire-hobbits, in which Saruman was killed by his servant, Gr?a Wormtongue.
 Although Sauron and Saruman were both defeated, the Wise did not achieve total victory. With the destruction of the One Ring, the Three Rings that had maintained the realms of the Elves in Middle-earth lost their power, and the Elves began to leave Middle-earth for the Undying Lands.


* War of Wrath
The end of the Elder Days.
 After E?endil came to Valinor to beg for the aid of the Valar, they sent a mighty force into Middle-earth to do battle with Morgoth. Led by E?w? the herald of Manw? the forces of the Valar, with the peoples of the Vanyar and the Noldor that had remained in Aman, sailed eastward in the ships of the Teleri.
 In the great battle that followed, Morgoth's armies were almost completely destroyed, and only a few of his Balrogs, Dragons and Orcs survived. Morgoth himself was taken as prisoner and shut beyond the confines of the World, and the Silmarils were recovered from his Iron Crown. In the tumult of the war, Beleriand and the lands to the north were destroyed and sunk beneath the sea, and the shape of Middle-earth was changed.

Mysterious denizens of the Last Desert.
 Creatures of an unknown kind, possibly mythical and presumably related to dragons, that were said to dwell in the Last Desert.
 Tolkien only ever mentions were-worms once, in the quote given above, so we know almost nothing about them. We cannot even be certain that they actually existed - the Hobbits had a rich folklore peopled with fantastic beings, and were-worms quite possibly fall into that category.
 If they did exist, the name 'were-worm' suggests a shapeshifting creature like a werewolf - a being that could take the form of either a Man or of a Dragon. Any discussion of the form or habits of the were-worms, though, must remain in the realms of speculation.

 The land between the Far Downs and the Tower Hills, granted to the Shire-hobbits by King Aragorn II Elessar in the early Fourth Age.


* Westron
The common tongue of the North-west of Middle-earth. Called also Common Speech.
-----
The Common Speech of Middle-earth.
 Derived mainly from Ad?aic, the ancestral tongue of the Edain and their kin, the Westron was widely spoken by the Men of Middle-earth. When the N?en?eans began to return to Middle-earth during the Second Age, Westron developed into a lingua franca allowing conversation between them and their distant kin. As the Second Age passed, and especially after the establishment of the N?en?ean kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor at the end of the Age, Westron became widely spoken by all races in Middle-earth, not just Men. Hence it is often referred to as the Common Speech.
 As the chief language of the northwest of Middle-earth, Westron is naturally represented in Tolkien's work by modern English, even to the extent that names of the ancient Westron form are also translated into equivalent forms based on Old English (prominent examples being Hobbit, Rivendell and Shelob, although many others occur). Hence, we have very few examples of 'real' Westron words and names. There are in fact only two significant sources. The first appears in the isolated notes at the end of Appendix F II of The Lord of the Rings, where 'banakil', and 'kuduk' (both referring to Hobbits) are given with some other examples. The second source is the names of the N?en?ean kings from Ar-Ad?akh? ('King, Lord of the West') to Ar-Pharaz? ('Golden King'); these are in Ad?aic, and hence closely related to Westron.


* Wetwang
The great marshland beneath the Emyn Muil.
 The name in the Westron tongue for the marshes beneath the Emyn Muil that the Elves called Nindalf.


* Wheat
An important cereal crop, used especially to be milled into flour. It is recorded as growing tall and golden in the land of Valinor.


* White Council
The Council of 'the Wise', formed to oppose Sauron, meeting at intervals from Third Age 2463 to 2953; usually referred to as 'the Council'.
-----
The Council formed to challenge Dol Guldur.
 The council formed in the Third Age by the chief among the Eldar and the Istari to combat the growing power of Sauron. The Council was led by Saruman, until Gandalf discovered his treachery at the beginning of the War of the Ring.


* White Downs|The Downs
The chalk-downs of the Shire's Westfarthing.
 A range of chalk downs in the western regions of the Shire; Michel Delving, the chief town of the Shire, was built (and burrowed) there.


* White Hand
An emblem of Saruman during the War of the Ring; a long white hand with one pointing finger.


* White House of Erendis|White House
The sanctuary of Erendis and Ancalim?
 A house that stood in the Emeri?region of the Mittalmar of N?enor. It was built for Erendis as a gift by Tar-Meneldur, to mark her betrothal to his son Aldarion. Aldarion spent many years away from N?enor in his ships, and the White House became a sanctuary for his wife Erendis, and their daughter, who would become Queen Tar-Ancalim?


* White Lady of Rohan
A title given to ?wyn by Faramir.
 A title given to by Faramir to ?wyn of Rohan. They married, and dwelt together in the hills of Emyn Arnen in Ithilien.


* White Mountains
The snow-capped peaks that separated Gondor from Rohan.
 Also called Ered Nimrais, an important mountain range in the southwest of the known parts of Middle-earth. In the latter part of the Third Age, they formed the border between Gondor in the south and Rohan in the north.


* White Rider

* White Tree of Minas Tirith|White Tree
The White Trees of Minas Ithil and Minas Anor. See Galathilion.
-----
A reminders of lost N?enor.
 A title of either of two white trees that grew in the courts of Minas Tirith, descended from Nimloth of N?enor, and ultimately (it is said) from Telperion itself.


* White Tree of N?enor|White Tree of Numenor|White Tree
Nimloth, the White Tree that grew in Armenelos.
 In the early days of N?enor, its people still had the friendship of the Elves of Tol Eress?. Among the gifts the Eldar gave to the early N?en?eans, one of the greatest was a white seedling of the tree Celeborn that stood in the middle of their island. Planted in the King's Court in Armenelos, the seedling grew into a fine White Tree that came to be known as Nimloth. Its blossoms appeared as the Sun set, and their perfume filled the night in N?enor's royal city.
 The tree of Tol Eress?, Celeborn, was itself descended from Galathilion, the White Tree that stood in Tirion that was made by Yavanna herself. Its descendant Nimloth stood in the courts of Armenelos for thousands of years, but when Sauron gained control of N?enor's government, he saw the White Tree as a link to his enemies the Valar, and ordered it destroyed. So the White Tree of N?enor was cut down and burned on the altar-fire of Sauron's temple.
 The line of Galathilion did not end in Sauron's flames. Isildur the son of Elendil had stolen a fruit from the Tree before it was lost. The fruit grew into a seedling that Isildur carried to Middle-earth with him after the Downfall of N?enor. That seedling was planted in Minas Ithil, and was destroyed before the end of the Second Age. Its seedling in turn grew into the first of the White Trees of Minas Tirith, a line that was to outlast Sauron himself.


* White Tree of Tol Eress?|White Tree of Tol Eressea|White Tree
The tree at the heart of the Lonely Isle.
 The White Tree that grew in the central regions of the island of Tol Eress?, more properly called Celeborn. It grew from a seedling of Galathilion, the White Tree made by Yavanna herself that grew in the courts of Tirion.


* White Tree of Valinor|White Tree
A title of Telperion, the elder of the Two Trees of Valinor, from whom the White Trees of N?enor and of Gondor were descended.


* White Wolves|White Wolf
Hunters out of the icy north.
 A type of wolf native to the frozen lands in the north of Middle-earth. They were not normally seen in Eriador, but seem to have remained among the snows of the Forodwaith and perhaps beyond.
 In the year III 2911, one of the harshest winters in Middle-earth's history descended, the so-called Fell Winter. The ice and snow of the north came at least as far south as the Shire. With them came the White Wolves, invading Eriador and roaming as far as the Shire. The frozen Brandywine River meant that they were even able to cross into the Eastfarthing. This was the last time the Horn-call of Buckland was used before the War of the Ring, one hundred and seven years later.


* Whiteskins
An Orkish name for the Rohirrim.
 A name among Orcs for the Riders of Rohan, whose far northern origins would have given them a much paler skin colour than the Men who lived around them.


* Whitwell
A township of the Tookland.
 A village or town near Tuckborough in the Shire's Tookland region, at the western end of the Green Hills. Thain Paladin Took II, Pippin's father, was known to farm the land around Whitwell, though it is not known whether he maintained a home there, or dwelt in the ancestral residence of the Tooks at Great Smials.


* Wild Elves
M?'s term for Dark Elves (Avari).


* Wild Lands
Term used in Rohan for the lands west of the Gap.


* Wild Men|Wild Man
The Men of Darkness; Men of the East and South of Middle-earth, who had fallen under the yoke of Morgoth during the First Age, and of whom many were allies of Sauron in the Second and Third Ages.


* Wild Men of the Woods|Wild Man of the Woods
A name for the Dr?dain in Rohan.
 At the end of the Third Age, a remnant of the Dr?dain still lived beneath the feet of the White Mountains, and in the lands westward. Theirs was a strange and ancient race of Men, with an unusual affinity with nature, and unique powers. The Northmen who settled in Rohan, though, knew nothing of their ancestry and imagined them to be hardly more than beasts, at least until the time of the War of the Ring. For this reason the Rohirrim called them the Wild Men of the Woods.


* Wilderland
The wilderness of Rhovanion.
 A term for the lands of Middle-earth that lay east of the Misty Mountains. 'Wilderland' probably represents the Westron equivalent of the Elvish name Rhovanion.


* Wildman of the Woods
One of the many aliases of T?in Turambar, used by him among the Men of the Forest of Brethil.


* Will Whitfoot|Old Will|Old Flourdumpling
Mayor of Michel Delving.
 The Mayor of Michel Delving (and therefore of the Shire) at the time of the War of the Ring. He was renowned as being the fattest Hobbit in the Westfarthing, and was affectionately referred to as Old Will or Old Flourdumpling. He was one of the first to be placed in the Lockholes during Sharkey's reign in the Shire, but survived the experience.


* William Huggins|Bill Huggins
A Stone-troll of the Trollshaws.
 With Tom and Bert, one of the three Trolls encountered by Bilbo and the Dwarves on their eastward journey to the Lonely Mountain. He seems to have been the leader of the troll-band - at least, it was he who led them to the woodlands of Trollshaws, according to his companions. It was William's pocket that Bilbo tried to pick as his first act of 'burglary', an attempt that brought the entire expedition close to disaster. Luckily, Gandalf was able to trick William and his two companions into arguing together until sunrise, whereupon they all turned to stone.
 The name 'William Huggins' seems a very remarkable and unlikely one for a Troll. It seems to be a translation by Tolkien of the Troll's 'real' name, as with the Hobbits, Dwarves, Rohirrim and so on, and the fact that it is recognisably English suggests that his original name was from a Mannish language. What William's name actually was, though, is a mystery. (By a curious coincidence, there was a real historical figure named William Huggins, a pioneering astronomer of the mid-nineteenth century, though it seems extremely unlikely that Tolkien's foul-mouthed Troll would be based on this noted scientist!)


* Willowbottom
A village on the course of Thistle Brook.
 A small village near Woody End in the Eastfarthing of the Shire. It stood on the banks of the stream called Thistle Brook, just above the place where that stream flowed into the River Shirebourn.

Weeping trees of the waterside.
 Waterside trees that grew throughout Middle-earth. The most famous of these was the ancient tree known as Old Man Willow, on the banks of the Withywindle in the Old Forest.

 After their discomfiture at the Ford of Bruinen by Elrond and Gandalf, the Nazg? returned to Sauron their master in the land of Mordor. There, he furnished them with horrible winged mounts and sent them abroad once again. While mounted on these flying beasts, they were known as the Winged Nazg?.


* Winged Shadows|Winged Shadow
The Nazg? on their winged steeds.
 A name for the Nazg? after they took to the skies on horrific winged steeds. This name refers especially to the profound dread and fear they inspired in those below them as the flew overhead.


* Wingfoot
?mer's name for Aragorn.
-----
"Wide wonder came into ?mer's eyes. 'Strider is too poor a name, son of Arathorn,' he said. 'Wingfoot I name you.'"
(The Two Towers III 2, The Riders of Rohan)
-----
When Aragorn first met ?mer, he had hunted the captors of Merry and Pippin across the wide fields of Rohan for four days. In that time, he and his companions Legolas and Gimli had covered forty-five leagues (that is, they had travelled about thirty-four miles each day). ?mer was so astonished by this feat that he gave Aragorn a new name: Wingfoot.


* Winterfilth
The tenth month of the Shire Calendar, approximately equivalent to modern October (in fact running from 22 September to 21 October on a modern calendar).


* Wiseman Gamwich
Ancestor of Samwise Gamgee.

* Wood of Greenleaves

A name of Aldarion's Haven-finder.
 A translation of Turuphanto, the nickname given to Aldarion's mighty ship the Hirilond?in the shipyards of R?enna where she was built.
 Aldarion sailed the Great Sea from N?enor to Middle-earth in the Wooden Whale at least twice. After the first voyage, the ship's prow was adorned with a jewelled eagle, a gift to Aldarion from his friend C?dan.


* Woodhall
A village in the Shire, at the foot of the Woody End slopes.
-----

* Woses|Wose
A Mannish name for the Dr?dain.
 A name among the Rohirrim for the shy, secretive people known in Elvish as the Dr?dain. Though never populous, the end of the Third Age saw these people reduced to a few populations in the southern parts of Middle-earth, especially in the Dr?aith Iaur and Dr?dan Forest of Rohan, where the Rohirrim came into contact with them.
 In fact, the word 'wose' is a name from British folklore, referring to a hairy, troll-like being supposed to inhabit woods and forests. It represents Tolkien's translation of an actual word of the Rohirrim into ancient English; the Rohirrim themselves would not have called such a creature a 'wose', but a r?.


* Wraith-world|Wraith world
The other side.
 An alternative aspect of reality, in which the Elves partly existed. Certain of the Rings of Power, and especially the One Ring, had the power to transport their bearer into the Wraith-world, making him appear to be invisible.


* Wraiths|Wraith
Spectral creatures of the Wraith-world.
 Ghostly beings that existed more in the hidden Wraith-world than our own. The most famous of these were the Ring-wraiths, Men ensnared by Sauron's Nine Rings, but their victims, too, were transformed into wraiths.


* Yavanna Kement?i|Yavanna
'Giver of fruits'; one of the Valier, numbered among the Aratar; the spouse of Aul? called also Kement?i.
-----
The Queen of the Earth.
 Called the 'Giver of Fruits', Yavanna was the Vala whose province was all growing things upon the earth. She was the spouse of Aul?the Smith.

* Years of the Sun
The count of years from the time of the First Age.
 The time after the first rising of the Sun until the present, beginning in the first year of the First Age.


* Years of the Trees
The centuries before the Sun and Moon.
 The long years that lay between the founding of Valinor and its Darkening. During this time, Valinor was lit by the light of the Two Trees, but Middle-earth lay in darkness.
 Long before the Elves awoke, Yavanna created the Two Trees of Valinor to give light to realm of the Valar. So began a reign of peace in Valinor, but Middle-earth was lit by starlight alone, and Melkor worked in the depths of Utumno in the north of the World. We are not told how long this time lasted, just that 'the ages drew on', so this period must have been at least 6,000 years, and probably longer. It was during this period that Aul?made the Dwarves, and set them to sleep until the coming of the Elves.
 When Orom?discovered that the Elves had awoken at Cuivi?en, great changes came about. The Valar made war on Melkor to protect the Elder Children of Il?atar; Utumno was destroyed and Melkor brought in chains to Valinor. The Valar also summoned the Elves to dwell in their land, and many answered this summons.
 A period of three ages (about 2,900 years) followed. Melkor was imprisoned in the halls of Mandos, and the Valar and Eldar dwelt together in the light of the Trees. In the darkness of Middle-earth, the Dark Elves who had not journeyed to Valinor still dwelt, and the Fathers of the Dwarves stirred. Men would not appear until some time after the end of the Years of the Trees.
 These Years came to an end when Manw?released Melkor from his imprisonment. For a time, the Dark Lord pretended friendship with the Eldar, but he turned back to the darkness. With Ungoliant, he destroyed the Trees, stole the Silmarils and fled back to the north of Middle-earth. Seeking revenge, F?nor led a great part of the Noldor out of Valinor and back to Beleriand.
 So the Years of the Trees came to an end. At this time, the Valar made the Sun and Moon to give light to the World, and the Years of the Sun began, and with them the First Age.
