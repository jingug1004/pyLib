This, the third volume of The History of Middle-earth, gives
us a privileged insight into the creation of the mythology
of Middle-earth, through the alliterative verse tales of two of
the most crucial stories in Tolkien's world -- those of Turin
and Luthien.
The first of the poems is the unpublished Lay of the
Children of Hurin, narrating on a grand scale the tragedy of
Turin Turambar.
The second is the moving Lay of Leithian, the chief source
of the tale of Beren and Luthien in The Silmarillion, telling of
the Quest of the Silmaril and the encounter with Morgoth in
his subterranean fortress.
Accompanying the poems are commentaries on the evolution
of the history of the Elder Days. Also included is the notable
criticism of The Lady of Leithian by C. S. Lewis, who read the
poem in 1929.
