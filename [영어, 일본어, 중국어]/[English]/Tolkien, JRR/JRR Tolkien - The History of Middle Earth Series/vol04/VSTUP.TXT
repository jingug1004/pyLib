      J. R. R. Tolkien: the master     
     storyteller who shaped the most
    compelling fantasy of all time...
                                      
 THE HOBBIT.                          
                                      
 The Lord of the Rings.                
                                      
 THE FELLOWSHIP OF                     
 THE RING                              
 THE TWO TOWERS.                       
 THE RETURN OF                         
 THE KING.                             

                     THE SONG OF TUOR.                 
                                                      
  "Then  the  magic  drifted  from  me  and  that music
  loosed its bands -                                   
  Far, far-off, conches calling - lo! I  stood in  the sweet
  lands,                                               
  And  the  meadows  were  about  me  where  the  weep-
  ing willows grew,                                    
 Where  the  long  grass  stirred  beside  me,  and  my
  feet were drenched with dew.                         
 Only the reeds were rustling,  but a  mist lay  on the
  streams.                                            
  Like a  sea-roke drawn  far inland,  like a  shred of
  salt sea-dreams.                                     
 "Twas   in   the   Land  of   Willows  that   I  heard
  th'unfathomed breath                                 
 Of  the  Horns  of  Ylmir calling - and  shall  hear  them
  till my death."
