  In  the  first  part  of  Sauron  Defeated  Christopher Tolkien
  completes  his  account  of  the  writing  of  The Lord  of the
  Rings:  beginning  with   Sam's  rescue   of  Frodo   from  the
  Tower  of  Cirith Ungol,  and giving  a very  different account
  of  the Scouring  of the  Shire, this  part ends  with versions
  of  the hitherto  unpublished Epilogue,  in which,  years after
  the  departure  of  Bilbo  and  Frodo  from  the  Grey  Havens,
  Sam attempts to answer his children's questions.               
   The second part is  an edition  of the  previously unpublished
  Notion  Club  Papers.  This  was  written  by   J.R.R.  Tolkien
  in  the  interval  between  The  Tv  o  Towers  and  The Return
  of  the  King.  These  mysterious  Papers,  discovered  in  the
  early years of the twenty-first century, report the discussions
  of a literary club  in Oxford  in the  years 1986-7,  in which,
  after an account  by one  of the  members of  the possibilities
  of  travel  in  space  and  time  through  the medium  of 'true
  dream', the centre of interest turns to the legend of Atlantis,
  the  strange  communications  received  by  other   memhers  of
  the  club out  of the  remote past,  and the  violent irruption
  of  the  legend   into  the   North-west  of   Europe.  Closely
  associated  with   the  Papers   is  a   new  version   of  the
  Numenorean   legend,   The    Drowning   of    Anadune,   which
  constitutes  the  third  part  of  the book.  At this  time the
  language of the Men of  the West,  Adunaic, was  first devised,
  and  the  book  concludes with  an elaborate  though unfinished
  account  of  its  structure  provided  by  Arundel  Lowdham,  a
  member  of  the  Notion  Club,  who learned  it in  his dreams.
