 The  Silmarillion,  foundation  of  the imagined  world of
 J.R.R.  Tolkien,  was  as is  well known  never completed,
 never brought to  a final  form after  the writing  of The
 Lord  of  the  Rings:  the  work  is  known from  the text
 published  posthumously  in  1977,  a   construction  from
 the narratives that existed, not a completion.           
   In   Morgoth's   Ring,  the   first  of   two  companion
 volumes,  Christopher  Tolkien  describes   and  documents
 the later history of The Silmarillion, from the  time when
 his father turned again to 'the Matter of the  Elder Days'
 after  The Lord  of the  Rings was  at last  achieved. The
 text of the Annals of Aman, the 'Blessed Land' in  the far
 West,  is  given  in  full;  while  in  writings  hitherto
 unknown is  seen the  nature of  the problems  that J.R.R.
 Tolkien explored in his  later years,  as new  and radical
 ideas,   portending  upheaval   in  the   old  narratives,
 emerged  at  the  heart  of  the  mythology,  and  as  the
 destinies  of  Men  and  Elves,  mortals   and  immortals,
 became  of  central significance,  together with  a vastly
 enlarged  perception  of  the evil  of Melkor,  the Shadow
 upon  Arda.  Among  these  writings  a  central  place  is
 given to  the Athrabeth  Finrod ah  Andreth, in  which the
 Elvish  King  of  Nargothrond  debates  with   the  'wise-
 woman' Andreth the injustice of human mortality.         
   The   second  part   of  this   history  of   the  later
 Silmarillion will  be concerned  with developments  in the
 legends  of  Beleriand  after the  completion of  The Lord
 of the Rings, and will include  the unpublished  story The
 Wanderings of Hurin.
